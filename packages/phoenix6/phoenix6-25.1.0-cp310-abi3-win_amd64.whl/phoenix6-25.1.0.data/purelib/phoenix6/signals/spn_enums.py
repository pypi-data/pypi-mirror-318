    Choose FusedCANcoder (requires Phoenix Pro) and Talon will fuse another
    CANcoder's information with the internal rotor, which provides the best possible
    position and velocity for accuracy and bandwidth (this also requires setting

    Note: When the feedback source is changed to FusedCANcoder or SyncCANcoder, the

class StaticFeedforwardSignValue(Enum):
    """
    Static Feedforward Sign during position closed loop.
    
    This determines the sign of the applied kS during position closed-loop modes.
    The default behavior uses the velocity reference sign. This works well with
    velocity closed loop, Motion Magic® controls, and position closed loop when
    velocity reference is specified (motion profiling).
    
    However, when using position closed loop with zero velocity reference (no motion
    profiling), the application may want to apply static feedforward based on the
    sign of closed loop error instead. When doing so, we recommend using the minimal
    amount of kS, otherwise the motor output may dither when closed loop error is
    near zero.
