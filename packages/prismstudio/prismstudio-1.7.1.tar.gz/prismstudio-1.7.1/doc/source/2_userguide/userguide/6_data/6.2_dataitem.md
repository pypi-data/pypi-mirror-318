# Searching Dataitems
Data items are specific pieces of information categorized within data components. Searching for data items within a specific data component is essential to navigate through the vast amount of data available and extract the precise information we need.

For example, the income statement component often contains hundreds of data items, including revenue, expenses, and profitability metrics. By specifying our search within the income statement, we can narrow down to the desired dataitems.

PrismStudio provides two ways to search for data items: programmatically using the dataitem function, which returns a Pandas DataFrame, and through the web UI.

**Programmatically Search for DataItems**
To programmatically search for a specific data item within a particular data component, use the dataitem function and provide a search query. The search query typically includes the name or description of the data item you are interested in. By executing the function, you will receive a Pandas DataFrame containing the search results.

In this example, the code [prismstudio.financial.income_statement.dataitems](<#prismstudio.financial.income_statement.dataitems>) is used to search for the specific dataitems related to net income. The returned result is stored in a pandas DataFrame.

```python
>>> ps.financial.income_statement.dataitems("Net Income")

    dataitemid                           dataitemname  ...             packagename
 0    100637                    Net Income to Company  ...  CIQ Premium Financials
 1    100639                               Net Income  ...  CIQ Premium Financials
 2    100644          Other Adjustments to Net Income  ...  CIQ Premium Financials
 3    100645  Net Income Allocable to General Partner  ...  CIQ Premium Financials
 4    100646   Net Income to Common Incl. Extra Items  ...  CIQ Premium Financials
 5    100647   Net Income to Common Excl. Extra Items  ...  CIQ Premium Financials
 6    100703                       Diluted Net Income  ...  CIQ Premium Financials
 7    100829                               Net Income  ...  CIQ Premium Financials
 8    100830               Net Income as per SFAS 123  ...  CIQ Premium Financials
 9    100831  Net Income from Discontinued Operations  ...  CIQ Premium Financials
10    100842                    Normalized Net Income  ...  CIQ Premium Financials

```

**Search for Dataitems in Web UI**

The Web UI provides an intuitive interface for searching and locating data items within the available datasets. Here's a step-by-step example of how to search for revenue data items in the income statement component:

**Navigating the Dataitems search page**

The DataItems search page in the Web UI provides a user-friendly interface for exploring and locating specific data items. Here's a guide on how to navigate the page effectively:

*Side Panel*
The side panel is located on the left-hand side of the page and allows you to categorically narrow down your search. It provides data categories that can be selected to filter the displayed data items.

```{note}
The search bar will only search for data items within the selected options on the side panel. If you want to search for data items across all categories, make sure to select the "All" option in the side panel.
```

*Displayed DataItems*
The displayed data items section showcases the results of your search. It presents information such as dataitemid, dataitemname, Category, Module, Component, package, and description for each data item. This information helps provide context and assists in identifying the desired data items.

Additionally, you can adjust the page viewing options to customize your browsing experience. You can select the number of data items to display per page, with options such as **`25`**, **`50`**, or **`100`**.

To navigate through the pages, use the **`>`** button to move to the next page, **`>>`** button to move to the last page, the **`<`** symbol to go back one page, and lastly, **`<<`** to move to the first page. These options allow for smooth navigation and efficient exploration of the data items.
