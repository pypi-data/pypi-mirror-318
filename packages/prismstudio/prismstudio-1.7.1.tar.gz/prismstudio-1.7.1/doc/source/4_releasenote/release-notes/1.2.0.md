### IMPROVEMENTS

- **Breaking Changes: Dataitems Retrieval**
    We're pleased to announce a significant update to the PrismStudio that introduces a more consistent and streamlined syntax across various modules. This release brings about changes in the way dataitems are accessed, reflecting our commitment to enhancing the usability and coherence of the PrismStudio Client. However, please be aware that these changes will require modifications to your existing code. Here are the details of the breaking syntax changes:

    Old Syntax Example:
    ```
    >>> com_di = prism.financial.commitment_dataitems()
    >>> est_di = prism.estimate.consensus_dataitems()
    ```

    New Syntax Example:
    ```
    >>> com_di = prism.financial.commitment.dataitems()
    >>> est_di = prism.estimate.consensus.dataitems()
    ```

    Action Required:
    To accommodate these syntax changes, you'll need to update your existing codebase wherever data items are accessed across different modules. Replace the previous _dataitems() method with the new .dataitems() method, as demonstrated in the new syntax examples provided above.

    We understand that adapting to changes in syntax can involve some adjustments, but we believe these updates will ultimately lead to more maintainable and comprehensible code. Should you have any questions or require assistance during this transition, please feel free to reach out to our dedicated support team.
