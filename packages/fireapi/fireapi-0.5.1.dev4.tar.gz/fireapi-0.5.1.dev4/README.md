## Overview

FireAPI is a Python client library that provides convenient access to the [24Fire REST API](https://apidocs.24fire.de/), allowing you to control KVM server functions using a private API key. The library supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations and includes type definitions for all request parameters and response fields.

- Get server configuration
- Get server status
- Start, stop, and restart the server
- Backup management (create, delete, list) *(exclusive to `24fire+` subscribers)*
- Retrieve monitoring timings and incidences *(exclusive to `24fire+` subscribers)*

> [!NOTE]
> Some features are exclusive to `24fire+` subscribers and have not been tested due to lack of subscription. If you encounter issues, please report them on GitHub.

## Installation

Install FireAPI using pip:

```bash
pip install fireapi
```

Alternatively, you can build and install the package manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EvickaStudio/24-Fire-REST-API.git
cd 24-Fire-REST-API
python -m build
pip install ./
```

## Usage

The FireAPI library provides both synchronous and asynchronous clients.

### Synchronous Usage

Import the `FireAPI` class and instantiate it with your API key:

```python
from fireapi import FireAPI

api_key = "your-api-key-here"
fire_api = FireAPI(api_key)
```

Use the provided methods to interact with the API:

```python
# Get server configuration
config = fire_api.vm.get_config()
print(config)

# Start the server
response = fire_api.vm.start_server()
print(response)
```

For more examples, see the [synchronous example](examples/synchronous_example.py).

### Asynchronous Usage

Import the `AsyncFireAPI` class and use it within an asynchronous function:

```python
import asyncio
from fireapi import AsyncFireAPI

async def main():
    api_key = "your-api-key-here"
    fire_api = AsyncFireAPI(api_key)
    
    # Get server configuration
    config = await fire_api.vm.get_config()
    print(config)
    
    # Start the server
    response = await fire_api.vm.start_server()
    print(response)

asyncio.run(main())
```

For more examples, see the [asynchronous example](examples/asynchronous_example.py).
