class Page:
    """
    A class representing a web page, capable of managing content, navigation bar,
    and JavaScript inclusion. It can compile and serve the final HTML based on a template file.

    Attributes:
            - `path` (os.PathLike | str | bytes): The file path to the HTML template.
            - `content` (list[HTMLElement]): A list of `HTMLElement` objects to be included in the page.
            - `title` (str | None): The title of the page (optional).
            - `javascript` (str): A string containing JavaScript code to be included in the page (default is empty).
            - `dynamic` (bool): Indicates if the page should use Dynamic UI features (e.g., WebSocket server for callbacks).
            - `running` (bool): A flag indicating if the page is actively running.
            - `inputs_saved_states` (dict): Stores the saved states of input elements on the page.
            - `head` (str): Custom HTML content to include in the `<head>` section of the template.
