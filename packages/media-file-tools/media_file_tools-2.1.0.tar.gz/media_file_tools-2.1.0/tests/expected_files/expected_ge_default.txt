Simon and Neil go on the promise of possible sex, while Will goes, enduring what he envisions as the horrors of camper van life, primarily to prove Jay's stories of his sexual conquests there as total lies. Will sees this as a win-win situation as if by chance Jay's stories are true, Will will also get to have sex. As the guys spend the weekend with Jay's parents, they begin to understand their friend Jay's behavior a little better. At the dance, Simon is hoping to do it with Becky, a girl who Jay has purportedly slept with and who wants to spend time with Simon after seeing his photograph beforehand.

The wheel-clamping of Simon's car might provide the answer.

Their first task is as volunteers in an old folks' home, where Daisy, Will's pretty ex-baby-sitter, is a care assistant, though his date with her goes wrong after a cruel prank played on him by Jay. And it is Jay's customarily sex-mad behaviour that gets the boys tossed off - an operative phrase - the scheme for good.

Simon, to the detriment of his own subjects, is excited when Carli comes to his house to revise, revealing that she is single again and rewarding him with kisses. Jay, for once, swaps lust for romance when he is smitten by Chloe, a sweet young girl from another school. Neil forgets his P.E. kit but gets through in his vest and pants and Will has an accident with his bowels after too many energy drinks but still gets his grades. However, Chloe drops Jay for being "too sensitive", Carli goes back to her ex-boyfriend and the boys end up with each other, useless lovers but good friends.

Against his principles Will takes the money at the door, when not fighting Alistair, but is thrilled when Charlotte returns and asks him to take part with her on the catwalk. Simon ends up modelling skimpy bathing trunks and, in his hurry to put them on, literally lets it all hang out. Unlike the onlookers, Carli is not amused.

None of the boys have smoked it before though and Will suffers severe side effects and takes to the stage to request an ambulance.

Simon, seriously dating Tara, arranges a double date for Will with her extremely tall and rapacious friend Kerry. Despite Will's efforts, she is not easy to shake off and, at Neil's dreary party, he dumps her, unaware that her father has just died, which leads to his vilification. Neil, however, takes advantage of the situation to have a happy birthday.

After Neil has wet the bed and Jay made an indecent proposal to a cold-stricken Dutch girl,all four boys are thrown out and Simon is still a virgin.

And he is right. Not only do they block the toilet and alter his Facebook picture but set about destroying more flowers in a neighbour's garden. Next morning the boys find themselves under siege from the angry gardener but there's no hiding place as Will's mother returns home early.

Will suggests a farewell camping trip for the four boys, though he is less than happy when the others use his possessions to light the camp-fire and Simon is not pleased when Neil and Jay let his car run into a lake. After a game in which each of them texts somebody on another's phone, Neil discovers that he is not a father after all and the boys bond in their own odd way.
