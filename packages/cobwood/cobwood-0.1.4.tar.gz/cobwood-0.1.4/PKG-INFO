Cobwood is a Python package designed to analyse global forest products markets.

Key Features:

- **Panel Data Structure**: The package employs panel data formatted with multiple years
  and countries, enabling comprehensive time-series and cross-sectional analysis.

- **Data Handling with Xarray**: Utilizes Xarray datasets to efficiently manage and
  manipulate multi-dimensional data structures.


# Model Formulation

The core implementation serves as a foundation for developing various versions of global
forest sector models. The data structure is intended to enable users to extend, or
customize the model to fit specific research or policy questions.

The first model formulation is based on GFPMX: "A Cobweb Model of the Global Forest
Sector, with an Application to the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic" by Joseph Buongiorno
https://doi.org/10.3390/su13105507

The GFPMX input data and parameters are available as a spreadsheet at:
https://buongiorno.russell.wisc.edu/gfpm/


## Equations

Equations are defined using Xarray time and country indexes so that they appear similar
to mathematical equations used in the papers describing the model. For example, the
consumption equation in `cobwood/gfpmx_equations.py` takes a dataset and a specific time
`t` as input and returns a data array as output. The input dataset `ds` contains price
and GDP data for all time steps and all countries, as well as price and GDP
elasticities. The computation at a given time and for a given set of countries is done
by using the time index `t` and the country index  `ds.c` (which represents all
countries in the dataset) as follows:

    def consumption(ds: xarray.Dataset, t: int) -> xarray.DataArray:
        """Compute consumption equation 1"""
        return (
            ds["cons_constant"]
            * pow(ds["price"].loc[ds.c, t - 1], ds["cons_price_elasticity"])
            * pow(ds["gdp"].loc[ds.c, t], ds["cons_gdp_elasticity"])
        )


# Data

The data is based on the FAOSTAT forestry production and trade data set available at:
http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FO/visualize


# Xarray

Cobwood implements simulations of the Global Forest Products Market (GFPM), covering
data for 180 countries over 80 years. Each equation within the model is structured over
two-dimensional Xarray data arrays, where:

- Countries form the first dimension (or coordinate), allowing for cross-sectional
  analysis.
- Years constitute the second dimension, facilitating time-series insights.

**Data Manipulation and Export**. Xarray data arrays can be converted to a format
similar to the original GFPMx spreadsheet with countries in rows and years in columns.
For example the following code uses `DataArray.to_pandas()` to convert the pulp import
array to a csv file using the pandas to_csv() method:

    from cobwood.gfpmx_data import GFPMXData
    gfpmx_data = GFPMXData(data_dir="gfpmx_8_6_2021", base_year = 2018)
    pulp = gfpmx_data.convert_sheets_to_dataset("pulp")
    pulp["imp"].to_pandas().to_csv("/tmp/pulp_imp.csv")

Example table containing the first few lines and columns:

| country | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |
|---------|------|------|------|
| Algeria | 66   | 61   | 56   |
| Angola  | 0    | 0    | 0    |
| Benin   | 0    | 0    | 0    |

The `DataArray.to_dataframe()` method converts an array and its coordinates into a long
format also called a tidy format with one observation per row.

    pulp["imp"].to_dataframe().to_csv("/tmp/pulp_imp_long.csv")

Example table containing the first few lines and columns:

| country | year | imp |
|---------|------|-----|
| Algeria | 2019 | 66  |
| Algeria | 2020 | 61  |
| Algeria | 2021 | 56  |
