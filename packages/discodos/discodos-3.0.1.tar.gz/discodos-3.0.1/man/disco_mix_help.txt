                 [-p POSITION] [--resume OFFSET]
                 [mix_name]

positional arguments:
  mix_name              mix name or mix ID being displayed, edited, created,
                        copied, deleted, etc. If mix_name is left out, a list
                        of available mixes is shown and all other arguments
                        are ignored.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         increases mix tracklist view detail. -v adds
                        tracknames, artists, transition rating/notes and
                        general track notes. -vv shows when and how
                        MusicBrainz matching was done and also direct weblinks
                        to Discogs releases, MusicBrainz releases/recordings
                        and AccousticBrainz recordings.
  -c, --create-mix      creates new mix (named as given in mix_name argument).
  -D, --delete-mix      deletes the mix (given in mix_name) and all its
                        contained tracks!
  -e POSITION, --edit POSITION
                        edits/adds details of a track in a mix (editable
                        fields: key, BPM, track number, position in mix, key
                        notes, transition rating, transition notes, general
                        track notes, custom MusicBrainz recording ID).
  -E, --edit-mix        edits/adds general info about a mix (name, played
                        date, venue).
  -b FIELDS, --bulk-edit FIELDS
                        bulk-edits specific fields of each track in mix.
                        Syntax of FIELDS argument: <field1>,<field2>,...
                        available fields:
                        key,bpm,track_no,track_pos,key_notes,trans_rating,
                        trans_notes,notes,m_rec_id_override.
  -a SEARCH_TERMS, --add-to-mix SEARCH_TERMS
                        searches for release/track in collection and adds it
                        to the mix, This option is actually a shortcut to
                        "disco search -m mix_name search_term" and behaves
                        identically. If SEARCH_TERMS is a number, it is
                        assumed being a Discogs release ID. A quick database
                        check is done and if non-existent yet, the release is
                        1) added to the Discogs collection and 2) imported to
                        DiscoBASE. This is a convenience function eg when
                        trying to quickly add a release to the mix that's not
                        in the DiscoBASE yet (possibly an only recently gained
                        record?).
  -r POSITION, --reorder-tracks POSITION
                        reorders tracks in current mix, starting at POSITION.
                        Note that this is a troubleshooting function and
                        usually shouldn't be necessary to use.
  -d POSITION, --delete-track POSITION
                        removes the track at the given position from the mix.
  --copy                copies the mix given in mix_name argument. Asks for
                        new name!
  -u, --discogs-update  updates tracks in current mix with additional info
                        from Discogs. Can be combined with -p when mix ID
                        provided or with --resume when mix ID not provided
                        (all tracks in mixes update).
  -z, --brainz-update   updates tracks in current mix with additional info
                        from MusicBrainz and AcousticBrainz. Leave out mix ID
                        to update every track contained in any mix. -z quick
                        match, -zz detailed match (takes longer, but more
                        results). Can be combined with -p when mix ID provided
                        or with --resume when mix ID not provided (all tracks
                        in mixes *Brainz matching).
  -p POSITION, --pos POSITION
                        in combination with -a this option adds the found
                        release/track at the given position in the mix (rather
                        than at the end). In combination with -u, -z or -zz
                        the update process is started at the given position in
                        the mix.
  --resume OFFSET       resumes long-running processes at the given offset
                        position (expects a number). You can combine this
                        option currently with "all tracks in mixes Discogs
                        update" (disco mix -u) or with "all tracks in mixes
                        *Brainz matching" (disco mix -z, disco mix -zz).
