                    search_terms

positional arguments:
  search_terms          The collection is searched for these terms. When
                        offline, it searches through all releases'
                        artists/titles only (eg tracknames not considered).
                        When online, the Discogs API search engine is used and
                        also tracknames, artists, labels and catalog numbers
                        are looked through. If your search term consists of
                        multiple words, put them inside double quotes (eg.
                        "foo bar term"). If you instead put a number as your
                        search term, it is assumed you want to view exactly
                        the Discogs release with the given ID. If search term
                        is the special keyword "all", a list of all releases
                        in the DiscoBASE is shown (including weblinks to
                        Discogs/MusicBrainz release pages). In combination
                        with -u, -z or -zz respectively, all tracks are
                        updated. Note that this is exactely the same as "disco
                        import" in combination with those options.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m MIX_NAME, --mix MIX_NAME
                        adds a track of the found release to the given mix ID
                        (asks which track to add in case -t is missing).
  -u, --discogs-update  updates found release/track with Discogs track/artist
                        details (asks which track to update in case -t is
                        missing).
  -z, --brainz-update   updates found release/track with additional info from
                        MusicBrainz and AcousticBrainz. (asks which track to
                        update in case -t is missing) -z quick match, -zz
                        detailed match (takes longer, but more results).
  -e, --edit            edits/adds details to a found release/track. Editable
                        fields: key, BPM, key notes, general track notes,
                        custom MusicBrainz recording ID. (asks which track to
                        edit in case -t is missing).
  -t TRACK_NUMBER, --track TRACK_NUMBER
                        in combination with -m this option adds the given
                        track number (eg. A1, AA, B2, ...) to the mix selected
                        using -m; in combination with -z or -u the given track
                        is the one being updated with *Brainz or Discogs
                        details; in combination with -e the given track is to
                        one to be edited.
  -p POS_IN_MIX, --pos POS_IN_MIX
                        in combination with -m this option states that we'd
                        like to insert the track at the given position (eg. 1,
                        14, ...), rather than at the end of the mix; in
                        combination with -z, -zz, -u or -e this option is
                        ignored.
  --resume OFFSET       resumes long-running processes at the given offset
                        position (expects a number). You can combine this
                        option currently with *Brainz matching operations only
                        (-z, -zz)
