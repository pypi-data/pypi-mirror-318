usage: disco [-h] [-v] [-o] {search,mix,suggest,import,setup} ...

the DiscoDOS CLI.


optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         increases output verbosity / shows what DiscoDOS is
                        doing under the hood (-v is INFO level, -vv is DEBUG
                        level).
  -o, --offline         DiscoDOS checks for connectivity to online services
                        (Discogs, MusicBrainz, AcousticBrainz) itself. This
                        option forces offline mode. A lot of options work in
                        on- and offline mode. Some behave differently,
                        depending on connection state.
