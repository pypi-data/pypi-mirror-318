aiohubspace
===========


    Connects to HubSpace API and provides an easy way to interact
    with devices.


This project was designed to asynchronously connect to the HubSpace API. It
has the ability to retrieve the devices and set new states. It was updated
from `hubspace_async` and merged with concepts from `aiohue`.
