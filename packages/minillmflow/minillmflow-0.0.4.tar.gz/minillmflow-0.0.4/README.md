A [100-line](minillmflow/__init__.py) minimalist LLM framework for agents, task decomposition, RAG, etc.

- Install via  ```pip install minillmflow```, or just copy the [source](minillmflow/__init__.py) (only 100 lines)

- **Pro tip:** Build LLM apps with LLMs assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) via [this prompt](assets/prompt)

## Why Mini LLM Flow?

Mini LLM Flow is designed to be **the framework used by LLMs**. In the future, LLM projects will self-programmed by LLMs themselves: Users specify requirements, and LLMs will design, build, and maintain. Current LLMs:

1. **üëç Shine at Low-level Implementation:**  LLMs can handle APIs, tools, chunking, prompting, etc. These don't belong in a general-purpose framework; they're too specialized to maintain and optimize.

2. **üëé Struggle with High-level Paradigms:** Paradigms like MapReduce, task decomposition, and agents are powerful. However, designing these elegantly remains challenging for LLMs.

The ideal framework for LLMs should (1) remove specialized low-level implementations, and (2) keep high-level paradigms to program against. Hence, I built this minimal (100-line) framework so LLMs can focus on what matters.  

Mini LLM Flow is also a great learning resource, as current frameworks abstract too much away.
