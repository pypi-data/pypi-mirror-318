        Connect this signal to a slot (callable). The connected slot will be invoked
        on each `emit()` call.

        Parameters
        ----------
        receiver_or_slot : object or callable
            If `slot` is omitted, this can be a standalone callable (function or lambda),
            or a bound method. Otherwise, this is treated as the receiver object.
        slot : callable, optional
            When `receiver_or_slot` is a receiver object, `slot` should be the method
            to connect. If both `receiver_or_slot` and `slot` are given, this effectively
            connects the signal to the method `slot` of the given `receiver`.
        conn_type : NxConnectionType, optional
            Specifies how the slot is invoked relative to the signal emitter. Defaults to
            `NxConnectionType.AUTO_CONNECTION`, which automatically determines direct or queued
            invocation based on thread affinity and slot type (sync/async).
        weak : bool, optional
            If `True`, a weak reference to the receiver is stored so the connection
            is automatically removed once the receiver is garbage-collected.
            If omitted (`None`), the default is determined by the decorator `@nx_with_signals`
            (i.e., `weak_default`).
        one_shot : bool, optional
            If `True`, this connection is automatically disconnected right after the
            first successful emission. Defaults to `False`.

        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            If the provided slot is not callable or if `receiver_or_slot` is not callable
            when `slot` is `None`.
        AttributeError
            If `receiver_or_slot` is `None` while `slot` is provided.
        ValueError
            If `conn_type` is invalid (not one of AUTO_CONNECTION, DIRECT_CONNECTION, QUEUED_CONNECTION).

        Emit the signal with the specified arguments. All connected slots will be

        the connection type and thread affinity.

        Parameters
        ----------
        *args : Any
            Positional arguments passed on to each connected slot.
        **kwargs : Any
            Keyword arguments passed on to each connected slot.

        Notes
        -----
        - When a connected slot is marked with `is_one_shot=True`, it is automatically
        disconnected immediately after being invoked for the first time.
        - If a slot was connected with a weak reference (`weak=True`) and its receiver
        has been garbage-collected, that connection is skipped and removed from the
        internal list of connections.
        - If the slot is asynchronous and `conn_type` is `AUTO_CONNECTION`, it typically
        uses a queued connection (queued to the slot’s event loop).
        - If an exception occurs in a slot, the exception is logged, but does not halt
        the emission to other slots.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : function
        A placeholder function that helps to define the signal's name and docstring. The

    - A typical usage looks like:

def nx_slot(func):
    """
    Decorator that marks a method as a 'slot' for PynneX. Slots can be either synchronous
    or asynchronous, and PynneX automatically handles cross-thread invocation.

    If this decorated method is called directly (i.e., not via a signal’s `emit()`)
    from a different thread than the slot’s home thread/event loop, PynneX also ensures
    that the call is dispatched (queued) correctly to the slot's thread. This guarantees
    consistent and thread-safe execution whether the slot is triggered by a signal emit
    or by a direct method call.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : function or coroutine
        The method to be decorated as a slot. If it's a coroutine (async def), PynneX
        treats it as an async slot.

    Returns
    -------
    function or coroutine
        A wrapped version of the original slot, with added thread/loop handling for
        cross-thread invocation.

    Notes
    -----
    - If the slot is synchronous and the emitter (or caller) is in another thread,
      PynneX queues a function call to the slot’s thread/event loop.
    - If the slot is asynchronous (`async def`), PynneX ensures that the coroutine
      is scheduled on the correct event loop.
    - The threading affinity and event loop references are automatically assigned
      by `@nx_with_signals` or `@nx_with_worker` when the class instance is created.

    providing automatic threading support for signals and slots.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls : class, optional
        The class to be decorated. If not provided, returns a decorator that can be
        applied to a class.
    loop : asyncio.AbstractEventLoop, optional
        An event loop to be assigned to the instances of the decorated class. If omitted,
        PynneX attempts to retrieve the current running loop. If none is found, it raises
        an error or creates a new event loop in some contexts.
    weak_default : bool, optional
        Determines the default value for `weak` connections on signals from instances of
        this class. If `True`, any signal `connect` call without a specified `weak` argument
        will store a weak reference to the receiver. Defaults to `True`.

    -------
    class
        The decorated class, now enabled with signal/slot features.

    Notes
    -----
    - This decorator modifies the class’s `__init__` method to automatically assign
      `_nx_thread`, `_nx_loop`, `_nx_affinity`, and `_nx_weak_default`.
    - Typically, you’ll write:
      ```python
      @nx_with_signals
      class MyClass:
          @nx_signal
          def some_event(self):
              pass
      ```
      Then create an instance: `obj = MyClass()`, and connect signals as needed.
    - The `weak_default` argument can be overridden on a per-connection basis
      by specifying `weak=True` or `weak=False` in `connect`.

    Example
    -------
    @nx_with_signals(loop=some_asyncio_loop, weak_default=False)
    class MySender:
        @nx_signal
        def message_sent(self):
            pass
