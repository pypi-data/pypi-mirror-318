## ⚠️ Please ensure your Brunata credentials work on [online.brunata.com][brunata] ⚠️

If your credentials don't work **AND** you use a different Brunata portal to view your metrics, please open an issue and/or merge request.

In most cases, you will likely have to add support for alternate portals yourself; I will gladly assist you in getting the authentication-flow working and finding the API endpoints. Then you can simply submit a Pull Request, and I'll review it when I have time 🙂

### ✨ Planned Features

- [x] Add support for more metrics

  - [x] 💧 Water consumption
