## ðŸ¥¥ Coconut

Implementation of Coconut, proposed by the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06769">Training Large Language Models to Reason in a Continuous Latent Space</a> out of FAIR, in Pytorch

Architecture wise, the closest work to the one proposed here would be <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/recurrent-memory-transformer-pytorch">RMT</a>, where the memory tokens there could serve as the continuous latent tokens. Both directions are worth exploring

## Install

```bash
$ pip install coconut-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from coconut_pytorch import Coconut

model = Coconut(
    num_reasoning_steps = 3,
    num_latents_per_step = 1,
    transformer = dict(
        num_tokens = 256,
        dim = 512,
        depth = 6
    )
)

prompt = torch.randint(0, 256, (2, 1024))
answer = torch.randint(0, 256, (2, 64))

loss = model(prompt, answer)
loss.backward()

# after much training

answer = model.generate(prompt, max_length = 64) # (2, 64)
```
