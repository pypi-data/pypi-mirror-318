# Nomenclature
# Centile formats describe the collection - the two most common used are the cole-nine-centiles format used in UK-WHO
# Each centile in the cole format is 2/3 of a standard deviation apart. They map to 0.04/2/9/25/50/75/91/98/99.6

# and the three-percent-centiles and five-percent-centiles are used by the CDC. They use 5/10/25/50/75/90/95 but also replace the 5th centile with a 3rd/97th centile..
# The eight-five-percent-centiles format is also used by the CDC and adds an extra 85th centile as well as extended centiles for BMI  [5.0, 10.0, 25.0, 50.0, 75.0, 85, 90.0, 98.0, 99.0, 99.9, 99.99 centiles] for use in BMI calculations - this is not used in the UK-WHO references.
