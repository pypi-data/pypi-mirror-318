robotpy-build
=============

This is a build tool intended to be generally useful for any python project
that has binary dependencies. It is especially designed to meet the needs
of RobotPy's various wrapper libraries, chiefly around:

* Managing upstream binary dependencies
* Autogenerating pybind11 wrappers around those dependencies
* Building wheels from those generated wrappers

Requires Python 3.8+
