		<h2>The absurdity of the Power 750 server</h2>
		<p>
			The Power 750 was an absurd purchase - 100% worth it - but still absurd.
			It came with 768GB of RAM (to be fair I didn't know this at the time)
			which means it wasn't a bad $100 purchase, but at the same time it'll
			only run big endian operating systems on it, which is hard to find now -
			plus it is incredibly loud
		</p>
		<p>
			It has been moved into a UCC (UWA's University Computer Club) rack, and
			is in theory on loan to them - but we are still trying to get it to boot
			(if anyone has a HMC please HMU), although the longer term goal is to
			run *something* (none of us know what yet lol) on it - although it may
			be too loud even by UCC standards
