		<h2>The server that runs a whole lot of nothing</h2>
		<p>
			bonesrunhome is an IBM x3550 M4 - it used to sit on my desk in
			my bedroom, however it is now in my rack in the living room, meaning I no longer have a lovely 1U space
			heater.
		</p>
		<p>
			I wound up with it as UCC (UWA's
			<a href="https://ucc.asn.au">University Computer Club</a>) was throwing
			out a bunch of them due to the unfortunate habit they had of kamikazing
			themselves. Thankfully there was one remaining that hadn't blown up and
			with a firmware update it should hopefully not blow up anytime soon :P
		</p>
		<p>
			I have since somehow wound up with a bunch more of these - they were for sale when I went to pickup the
			BladeCenter, and I couldn't say no (I should have).
			They are not in use now, and I can't see myself using them anytime <s>soon</s> ever - but they have had
			their firmware updated so they shouldn't blow up anymore! If you live in Perth and want some (I don't know
			why you would, they cost me $25, but at this point I would probably give you one if you asked nicely lol)

				Anyway, back to bonesrunhome, which currently has two Xeon E5-2697 v2's (24 total cores at 3.50GHz) and
				384GB of RAM with EndeavourOS as it's operating system. It used to live in my bedroom on my desk -
				which, considering it is a 1U server, was as painful as it sounds.
				However, after buying a <a href="myRack.html">rack</a> it has been moved into my living room (sorry
				housemates). It currently runs "most" of my stuff on virtual machines (all setup through libvirt),
				including my
				FreeIPA setup, and the webserver hosting this, and my git server.
				You are welcome to try seeing my git server, just run
				<code><span class="sh">ssh</span> git.mahoosively.gay</code> in your terminal (I have no idea if this
				works with Windows terminal as I avoid Windows as much as I can). I don't think I have really bothered
				to use this much for my public/collaborative, although I will hopefullly be using it more soon (group
				projects would not have been fans of me not using Github lol). I have setup a 4 drive raid-10 setup with
				mdadm to store the repos, so hopefully it will be reliable enough to use. If you want a bit more info on
				what the git server is, I am using <a href="https://charm.sh/blog/self-hosted-soft-serve/">Soft
					Serve</a>
