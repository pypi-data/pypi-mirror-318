		<h1>... Look, an attempt was made</h1>

		<!-- <h2>
							So, uh, I guess this is my website, front end isn't what I would call a passion of mine lol
						</h2> -->
		<h3>An about me:</h3>

		<p>
			Heya! I'm Seb, and my pronouns are they/them.
			I'm studying
			computer science at UWA, and this is my attempt at a (low effort) personal website.
		</p>
		<h4>Interests</h4>
		<p>
			So, in case it wasn't obvious, I kinda enjoy messing around with computers. I am very much the stereotypical
			Linux user, and while I do enjoy making things "pretty" (I mean, I <i>am</i> a contributor to Catppuccin), I
			usually
			enjoy High Performance Computing, as well as Data Formatting and Automating anything I can (I have 100% spent
			more time automating something than it would have taken to just do it manually). I also go crazy for
			anything with
			Linux (the more absurd the better). I am also currently (2024) the Vice-President of the <a
				href="https://ucc.asn.au">University Computer Club</a> and take great joy in the amount of
			<s>sensible</s> projects the club gets up to (ask me about Coffinfish sometime!).

		</p>

		<h4>Skills</h4>
		<p>
			So, I am pretty proficient in using Python and C++ (though I will begrudgingly use C if needed), and while I
			am probably a bit rusty, I did enjoy Java when I last used it in uni. Sadly, I have written a bunch of code
			in JavaScript (including a <s>lovely</s> flavour called Google Apps Script), and so I am perfectly happy to
			write code in that, although I do prefer Typescript. If I am forced to write a bash script, I will
			unironically use Amber instead, until it doesn't work lol. I have done a database class where I learnt SQL,
			however I am probably a little rusty. Obviously I can use HTML and CSS lol - I have dabbled with a bit of
			React in the form of RedwoodJS and a tad of Deno (and no, I am not turning this page into a React page
			lmao).
		</p>
		<p>
			I am perfectly comfortable using Numpy and Matplotlib in Python, and I have done network programming, as
			well as using MPICH and OpenMP for multi-threading and multi-node computing in C/C++, and enjoyed it
			immensely.
		</p>
		<p>I am <i>incredibly</i> at ease at using the command line on Unix systems lol - I am not exaggerating when I
			say I am more comfortable and proficient at using (and fixing/trouble shooting) Linux systems compared to
			Windows systems. I take great
			joy in running the most cooked and cursed setups as my daily driver, and I am currently using Bedrock Linux
			with an EndeavourOS stratum and an Alpine Linux stratum </p>

			<h4>A list of my (constantly) changing projects</h4>
			<details open>
				<summary>Software</summary>
				<p><i>Full warning, the following will almost immediately be out of date, but I'll do my best to keep it
						updated - if in doubt, check my <a href="https://github.com/Sebagabones">Github</a>. </i></p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						A RedwoodJS website for better management of <a href="https://ucc.asn.au">UCC</a>'s member VM's,
						replacing the Proxmox UI. This started out as a Pulumi project to speed up VM creation, and
						while there may still be part of that in the CI side of it, I am now planning to probably try to
						just use the Proxmox API.
					</li>
					<li>
						Theming for KDE's Labplot, to add Catppuccin themes to it - this will hopefully be finished
						soon<sup>tm</sup>. In true fashion, it all works, I am just running into the classic issue where
						finishing the last 10% of the documentation is harder than the rest of it was. If you want to
						try it out,
						my repository is <a href=https://github.com/Sebagabones/labplot>here</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						The <a href="https://github.com/catppuccin/vimium">Vimium Catppuccin port</a> which I maintain
						(which, to be honest, has needed very little maintenance so far).
					</li>
					<li>
						My <a href="emacsFiles.html">Emacs config files</a> - apparently I am weird because I used Emacs
						in the terminal (hence the corfu terminal package). I use Doom Emacs because I am lazy, which is
						why my files may look
						different to yours (yes this isn't really related to Software but I was running out of
						things to include that weren't uni related).
					</li>
					<li>
						Which, speaking of university assignments, a particular favourite of mine was the second
						assessment in High Performance Computing - while I probably <i>shouldn't</i> openly show my code
						due to personal doubts on the unit content changing, I can still show off my <a
							href="report.html">report</a>!
						Be warned, this is genuinely one of the daftest ways
						I have spent my time.

					</li>
				</ul>
			</details>

			<details open>
				<summary>Hardware</summary>
				<p><i>This is mostly up to date, however the pages linked to from here may not be yet</i></p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						My current daily driver is (sadly) not very exciting from a hardware perspective - it is an Asus
						Zenbook 13, which has me trapped in its OLED clutches. However, finding the hardware too
						sensible for my standards, my solution was to make the Operating System as cursed as possible,
						which is how I wound up running <a href="https://bedrocklinux.org/">Bedrock Linux</a> with an
						EndeavourOS stratum along with an Alpine Linux stratum (and I have also installed the Nix
						package
						manager too of course). This has a <i>very</i> Catppuccin themed i3 setup, although sadly
						overall it mostly "just works<sup>tm</sup>" too often for my liking.
					</li>
					<li>
						An X270 thinkpad that is running FreeBSD, which I have been slowly
						upgrading with a new IPS FHD screen, new larger batteries, a 1TB
						Samsung M.2 SSD and 16GB of ram. Alas, after writing some incredibly fun scripts to avoid the
						forsaken
						BD-PROCHOT, I have pretty much stopped using it lol.
					</li>
					<li>
						An x201 thinkpad that is running Alpine Linux with i3 (yes I know -
						I'm falling down the rabbit hole even more) - this has been upgraded
						as far as it can go (8 GB of ram let's go). This has also been phased out of regular use, mostly
						due to
						the screen being borderline painful to use.
					</li>

					<li>
						An IBM x3200 M3 server (<a href="bonescallhome.html">bonescallhome</a>) which is no longer
						hosting
						this
						webpage - in fact, this is no longer even at my house! I found it too sensible, and so in true
						fashion
						for myself, I gave it to a friend.
					</li>

					<li>
						An IBM x3550 M4 server (<a href="bonesrunhome.html">bonesrunhome</a>)
						which is running a few VMs (including a debian VM which is dedicated
						to web-hosting)
					</li>

					<li>
						A project that has now been put on the back burner: a Toshiba T3200 -
						this has a whopping 4MBs of ram, with a 40MB hard drive. Currently it
						isn't booting, and so my focus is to fix/replace the floppy disk drive
						(this is very much on the back burner on account of it now no longer
						turning on lol - unsure why, but it seems I may have let the magic
						smoke out- hopefully I'll fix it one day)
					</li>
					<li>
						A ThinkPad 770z running Tiny Core Linux. This has had it's hard drive (an IBM <s>Deskstar</s>
						Deathstar
						that had started rattling) replaced with an SD card, and was an adventure in finding a Distro
						that
						supported such an old CPU. I setup some sort of window manager on it, iirc IceWM, and have
						promptly
						not
						used it since.
					</li>
					<li>
						An IBM x3650 M2 (<a href="bonescrawlhome.html">bonescrawlhome</a>). This is not and will never
						be
						used -
						if you live in perth and want it hmu
						lmao.
					</li>

					<li>
						Another (short-lived) acquisition is an IBM
						<a href="Power7.html"> Power 750 Express.</a>
					</li>

					<li>
						<a href="bonesboundhome.html">bonesboundhome</a> an IBM x3650 M4 that is running as my secondary
						server
						alongside <a href="bonesrunhome.html">bonesrunhome</a>.
					</li>

					<li>
						I also have an IBM bladecenter H, but I have no idea what I will ever
						use it for - this may be destined to die a horrible death soon, mostly due to the fact that <a
							href="https://ucc.asn.au">UCC</a> tries to
						murder me whenever it starts up.
					</li>

					<li>
						<a href="myRack.html" class="rackCall">The server rack</a> that is currently heating
						my living room.
					</li>
