		<h2>The server I actually turned off</h2>
		<p>
			In keeping with the mostly IBM/Lenovo theme - bonescallhome is an IBM
			x3650 M2 which has since been decomissioned, partly due to lack of
			pointfulness, but also due to unreliablity - this had a bit (roughly
			1.5TB) of hardware setup raid storage (about 400GB of raid 1E & just
			under 1TB of raid 5), although it was only running two dual core Xeon
			CPUS with 12 GB of DDR2 (!) RAM.
		</p>
		<p>
			My plan for this was to <em>possibly</em> set this up to store a backup
			of the fast storage I am planning to setup on
			<a href="bonesrunhome.html">bonesrunhome</a>, possibly by swapping in
			the hard drives from <a href="bonescallhome.html">bonescallhome</a> - but I have since realised that it is
			simply too old for any sort of use, and so it'll probably just sit in my store room until I take it to
			ewaste.
