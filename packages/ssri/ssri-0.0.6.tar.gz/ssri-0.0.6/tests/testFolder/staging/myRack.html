		<h2>My amazing rack</h2>
		<p>
			So I now have a server rack! To be honest it <em>is</em> considerably
			larger than I was expecting, but otherwise it's quite a nice server rack - although it was quite loud when I
			picked it up lmao.

						After having an ex-housemate ask me to turn it off because it was too loud, I realised other
						people may
						not
						be as deaf as me and that I should probably do something about the noise.

						My grand scheme, (which, to be honest, turned out quite well) was to tackle the noise issue in
						three
						parts:
					</p>
				</div>

			</div>
		</div>



		<h5>Part A: Sound Deadening</h5>
		<p>
			Realising that a 1U server makes a considerable amount of noise, I knew I had to do my best to try stop
			noise from escaping out of the server rack itself. Initially, I was planning to only use acoustic foam,
			however on a trip back home to the Northen Territory, I found some road noise deadening, designed to go
			inside car panels
			(Series Land
			Rovers used to be a hyperfixation of mine before I moved away for uni, and so of course I had noise
			deadening laying around lol). I posted this back to Perth, and covered the inside of the rack with it
			(including the
			rear side, which was meant to be left open for hot air to be pushed out the back - more on this later).
		</p>
		<p>
			I then went and bought a few panels of acoustic egg-carton shaped foam, which I then glued over the sound
			deadening, and pretty much anywhere in the rack that I could. My note for anyone following along at home, I
			would recommend using good quality glue - if I were to redo this, I would want to use a different glue than
			what I used, as
			I spent a long time reattaching panels.
		</p>
		<p>
			This did help significantly, but I wasn't finished yet...
		</p>
		<h5>Part B: My Biggest Fan(s)</h5>
		<p>
			So, remember how I mentioned I covered the back of the server rack with sound deadening? Yes? Great - well,
			you're not <i>meant</i> to do that.
			Thankfully, the designers of this rack foresaw my idiocy, and chucked two whopping great 240 volt fans into
			a box on the top of the rack. This was great, they moved a heap of air, however, there was one small
			problem. They were, really, really, loud. Ironically, this meant that my housemate at the time was not my
			biggest fan.
		</p>
		<p>
			But! There was a solution! The rack thankfully had mounting holes for regular PC 120mm fans! Now, you may be
			saying, "But Seb, how would you power those? Your servers don't have PWM headers, and even if they did, you
			would have to run them out of the case" - and, dear reader, you would be right. Except, if you were saying
			this, you forgot about the magic of janky electronics off of eBay. It turns out, you can buy a 240 volt to
			12 volt molex adapter, which you can then plug into a molex to sata power adapter. You can then plug this
			into a PCIE fan hub/controller, which you can plug the fans into. Would I recommend doing this? No - please
			don't do this. Have I had any fires yet? No, but I do live every day in fear (which may just be the GAD but
			moving
			on).
		</p>
		<p>
			So, the fans I ended up going with were some high speed be quiet! Silent Wings 4, which seem to provide
			enough airflow (which was needed due to me covering up the back of the rack), while being significantly
			quieter.
		</p>
		<h5>Part C: Fan Control</h5>
		<p>
			And so we get to the final part - actually making the hardware in the rack be quieter.
		</p>
		<p>
			My first improvement was to add Noctua fans to my old switch - yes, these 40mm fans costed more than the
			switch did, but on the upside, they are much quieter than the Delta fans that were on it (although it did
			involve me immediately loosing the warranty on the fans I had just bought due to having to rewire the
			connections as the switch did not use standard PWM headers lol)
		</p>
		<p>
			Then, I stumbled upon an amazing set of reddit posts, that described how to slow down the fans in IBM x3550
			M4 servers (this also works in IBM x3650 M4 models) with ipmitool. Using this, I wrote a script in Python to
			monitor the temps of the server, and change the fan speeds accordingly - this is a very janky solution, and
			was done a long time ago by me - I promise I have improved significantly since lol, but in saying that, it
			works, and I am lazy, so I haven't gone back and rewritten it.
			I also wrote this in C, however, that arguably is not much more sensible, and honestly I would say to create
			your own more sensible implementation. If you really wanna see my code, you can view the repo <a
				href="https://github.com/Sebagabones/Shutting_Up_My_IBM">here</a>. Jankiness aside, it has worked well,
			and the servers are running a lot quieter.
