		<h2>The almost sensible server</h2>
		<p>bonesboundhome is an IBM x3650 M4</p>
		<p>
			I grabbed it from some random business off marketplace, and with a
			firmware update it hopefuly won't blow up anytime soon lol
		</p>

		<p>
			It currently has two Xeon E5-2650's and 384GB of RAM with EndeavourOS (I still do not know why I did
			this,
			one day I'll install Alpine)
			as an operating system. This was running my git server, however at the time of writing that isn't
			running
			right now, due to NetworkManager disliking me, and me disliking NetworkManager enough to not be bothered
			to
			fix it right now. This was running my NFS server, with NVME storage added in via PCIE,
			which was mostly setup so I could run MPICH at home for my HPC unit (the class had run out of credit on
			Setonix and I wasn't going to waste the opportunity for the homelab to actually be useful for once
			lmao).
		</p>

		<p>
			I also have written a custom fan curve for this in C - which I will
			eventually add to my github - although I did write a version of it in
			python for bonesrunhome, which is alive and well on my github. Arguably the Python implementation is much
			more sensible, as it isn't doing much more than just running as a script that calls a system call.
