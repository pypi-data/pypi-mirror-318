Checking of formatting and cod quality is now regularly performed in CI.

What it is?
===========

PyTables is a library for managing hierarchical datasets and
designed to efficiently cope with extremely large amounts of data with
support for full 64-bit file addressing.  PyTables runs on top of
the HDF5 library and NumPy package for achieving maximum throughput and
convenient use.  PyTables includes OPSI, a new indexing technology,
allowing to perform data lookups in tables exceeding 10 gigarows
(10**10 rows) in less than a tenth of a second.

Acknowledgments
===============

Thanks to many users who provided feature improvements, patches, bug
reports, support and suggestions.  See the ``THANKS`` file in the
distribution package for a (incomplete) list of contributors.  Most
specially, a lot of kudos go to the HDF5 and NumPy makers.
Without them, PyTables simply would not exist.
