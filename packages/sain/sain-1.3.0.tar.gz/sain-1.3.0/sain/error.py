"""Interfaces for working with Errors.

This exposes one abstract interface, `Error` that other errors can implement and use as an argument to match upon.

Usually this error is returned from a `Result[T, Error]` object.

Those errors can be converted into `RuntimeError` exceptions by calling `sain.Result.unwrap` and `sain.Option.unwrap`.

For an example

```py
# Read the env variable, raises `RuntimeError` if it is not present.
path: Option[str] = Some(os.environ.get('SOME_PATH')).unwrap()
```

HTTP requests are good example where errors can be returned all the time.
Lets implement one.

Example
-------
from sain import Error
from dataclasses import dataclass

# Base error.
class HTTPError(Error):
    ...

@dataclass
class NotFound(HTTPError):
    message = "Response not found."
    response: requests.Response

    def description(self) -> str:
        ...

    Notes
    -----
    This function also catch exceptions such as `KeyboardInterrupt` and `SystemExit`,
    so try to use it with extreme caution.

    Example
    -------
    ```py

    fn: `Callable[[], R]`
        The function to run.

    Returns
    -------
