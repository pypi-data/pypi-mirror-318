"""Frequentist confidence interval estimation.

(Frequentist) confidence interval interpretation, with 95% coverage: **If we
are to take several independent random samples from the population and
construct confidence intervals from each of the sample data, then 95 out of 100
confidence intervals will contain the true mean (true proportion, in this
context of proportion)**.
