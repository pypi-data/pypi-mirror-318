        The parameterisation of the Beta prior to consider. Use
        :math:`\lambda=1` for a flat prior.  Use :math:`\lambda=0.5` for
        Jeffrey's prior.
    coverage
        A floating-point number between 0 and 1.0 indicating the coverage
        you are expecting.  A value of 0.95 will ensure 95% of the area under
        the probability density of the posterior is covered by the returned
        equal-tailed interval.

        Seven 1-D floating point arrays corresponding to:

        * Precision
        * Recall
        * The thresholds used to evaluated the selected metrics

        * The lower confidence interval for the Recall
        * The upper confidence interval for the Precision

    r"""Compute average precision (AP) from prediction scores.

    This function mimics the scikit-learn API, except it also returns lower and
    upper bounds considering the credible regions defined in each threshold.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true
        Ground truth (correct) labels.
    y_score
        Target scores, can either be probability estimates of the positive
        class, confidence values, or non-thresholded measure of decisions (as
        returned by âdecision_functionâ on some classifiers).
    lambda_
        The parameterisation of the Beta prior to consider. Use
        :math:`\lambda=1` for a flat prior.  Use :math:`\lambda=0.5` for
        Jeffrey's prior.

    Returns
    -------
        A tuple with 3 floats:

        * the area under the ROC (FPR vs. TPR) curve
        * the lower bound considering the credible region defined by
