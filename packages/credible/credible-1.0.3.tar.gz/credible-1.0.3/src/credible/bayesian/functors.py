def make_functor(fun, lambda_=1.0, coverage=0.95) -> CIFunctor:
    r"""Decorate a function to operate across the library, with scalar inputs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fun
        Function to be decorated.
    lambda_
        The parameterisation of the Beta prior to consider. Use
        :math:`\lambda=1` for a flat prior.  Use :math:`\lambda=0.5` for
        Jeffrey's prior.  Changes in this value do not significantly affect the
        outcome, unless ``tp`` or ``fp`` are very small (close to 1).
    coverage
        A floating-point number between 0 and 1.0 indicating the coverage
        you're expecting.  A value of 0.95 will ensure 95% of the area under
        the probability density of the posterior is covered by the returned
        equal-tailed interval.

    Returns
    -------
        The decorated function.
