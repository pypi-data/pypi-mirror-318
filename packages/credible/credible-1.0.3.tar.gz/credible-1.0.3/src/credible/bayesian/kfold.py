    AKA positive predictive value (PPV), mean, mode and credible intervals.  It

    **binary** classification problems.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true
        Ground truth (correct) labels.
    y_pred
        Predicted labels, as returned by a classifier.
    rng
        An initialized numpy random number generator.
    lambda_
        The parameterisation of the Beta prior to consider. Use
        :math:`\lambda=1` for a flat prior.  Use :math:`\lambda=0.5` for
        Jeffrey's prior.  Changes in this value do not significantly affect the
        outcome, unless ``tp`` or ``fp`` are very small (close to 1).
    coverage
        A floating-point number between 0 and 1.0 indicating the coverage
        you're expecting.  A value of 0.95 will ensure 95% of the area under
        the probability density of the posterior is covered by the returned
        equal-tailed interval.
    nb_samples
        Number of generated variates for the M-C simulation.

    Returns
    -------
        A tuple with 4 floating-point numbers:
