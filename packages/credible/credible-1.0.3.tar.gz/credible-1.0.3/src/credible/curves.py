    """Calculate lower and upper confidence intervals of a curve.

    This function calculates the hulls for 2 curves that are formed from points
    defining the lower and upper bounds of the curve's credible/confidence
    intervals for each measured threshold.

    It returns the curve (no changes), as well as the lower and upper bounds of
    the (central) curve.

    To calculate the upper and lower curves, we do not consider the extremities
    of the upper and lower bounds, as those points would translate to
    pessimistic estimations of the true confidence interval bounds.  Instead,
    we simply find the intersection of a straight line from the origin (0,0)
    and the ellipse 90-degree sector inscribed in the appropriate quarter of a
    rectangle centered at the ROC point, and its lower and upper bound CI
    estimates on both directions (horizontal and vertical).  If
    ``extrapolate_from_origin`` is set to ``False``, then intersections are
    created from ``(x, y) = (1, 0)``.

        * The lower confidence interval for the selected metric for the first

        * The lower confidence interval selected metric for the second axis
        * The upper confidence interval for the selected metric for the first
          axis
        * The upper confidence interval selected metric for the second axis
    extrapolate_from_origin
        To calculate the upper hull, we consider two distinct cases: if
        ``extrapolate_from_origin`` is ``True`` (default), then we consider the
        curve starts (or finishes) at coordinate ``(x,y) = (1,0)`` and finishes
        (or starts) at ``(x,y) = (0,1)``.  This is the case if the user is
        plotting TPR against TNR or FPR against FNR.  If
        ``extrapolate_from_origin`` is ``False``, then we consider the curve
        starts (or finishes) at ``(x,y) = (0,0)``, and finishes (or starts) at
        ``(x,y) = (1,1)``.

        If ``extrapolate_from_origin`` is ``True`` (default), each point of the
        curve to extrapolates to the right and upper points defined by the
        upper bounds of the credible/confidence intervals, and to the left and
        lower points defined by the lower bounds of the intervals.

        If ``extrapolate_from_origin`` is ``False``, each point of the curve to
        extrapolates to the left and upper points defined by the upper bounds
        of the credible/confidence intervals, and to the right and lower points
        defined by the lower bounds of the intervals.

    Returns
    -------

          curve, for the first and second coordinates respectively.
        * upper: Two 1D arrays of floats that expresses the upper-bound of
