"""Functions to evalute the (Bayesian) credible region of measures.

(Bayesian) credible region interpretation, with 95% coverage: The probability
that the true proportion will lie within the 95% credible interval is 0.95.

Contrary to frequentist approaches, in which one can only say that if the test
were repeated an infinite number of times, and one constructed a confidence
interval each time, then X% of the confidence intervals would contain the true
rate, here we can say that given our observed data, there is a X% probability
that the true value of :math:`k/n` falls within the provided interval.

See a discussion in `Five Confidence Intervals for Proportions That You
Should Know About <ci-evaluation_>`_ for a study on coverage for most common
methods.

.. note::

   For a disambiguation with `Confidence Interval <confidence-interval_>`_ (the
   frequentist approach), read `Credible Regions or Intervals

def beta(

) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    r"""Return the mode, upper and lower bounds of the equal-tailed credible
    region of a probability estimate following Bernoulli trials.

    This technique is (not) very conservative - in most of the cases, coverage
    closer to the extremes (0 or 1) is lower than expected (but still greater
    than 85%).

    This implementation is based on [GOUTTE-2005]_.  It assumes :math:`k`
    successes and :math:`l` failures (:math:`n = k+l` total trials) are issued
    from a series of Bernoulli trials (likelihood is binomial).  The posterior
    is derivated using the Bayes Theorem with a beta prior.  As there is no
    reason to favour high vs.  low precision, we use a symmetric Beta prior
    (:math:`\alpha=\beta`):

    .. math::

       P(p|k,n) &= \frac{P(k,n|p)P(p)}{P(k,n)} \\
       P(p|k,n) &= \frac{\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}P(p)}{P(k)} \\
       P(p|k,n) &= \frac{1}{B(k+\alpha, n-k+\beta)}p^{k+\alpha-1}(1-p)^{n-k+\beta-1} \\
       P(p|k,n) &= \frac{1}{B(k+\alpha, n-k+\alpha)}p^{k+\alpha-1}(1-p)^{n-k+\alpha-1}

    The mode for this posterior (also the maximum a posteriori) is:

    .. math::

       \text{mode}(p) = \frac{k+\lambda-1}{n+2\lambda-2}

    Concretely, the prior may be flat (all rates are equally likely,
    :math:`\lambda=1`) or we may use Jeoffrey's prior (:math:`\lambda=0.5`),
    that is invariant through re-parameterisation.  Jeffrey's prior indicate
    that rates close to zero or one are more likely.

    The mode above works if :math:`k+{\alpha},n-k+{\alpha} > 1`, which is
    usually the case for a resonably well tunned system, with more than a few
    samples for analysis.  In the limit of the system performance, :math:`k`
    may be 0, which will make the mode become zero.

    For our purposes, it may be more suitable to represent :math:`n = k + l`,
    with :math:`k`, the number of successes and :math:`l`, the number of
    failures in the binomial experiment, and find this more suitable
    representation:

    .. math::

       P(p|k,l) &= \frac{1}{B(k+\alpha, l+\alpha)}p^{k+\alpha-1}(1-p)^{l+\alpha-1} \\
       \text{mode}(p) &= \frac{k+\lambda-1}{k+l+2\lambda-2}

    This can be mapped to most rates calculated in the context of binary
    classification this way:

    * Precision or Positive-Predictive Value (PPV): p = TP/(TP+FP), so k=TP, l=FP
    * Recall, Sensitivity, or True Positive Rate: r = TP/(TP+FN), so k=TP, l=FN
    * Specificity or True Negative Rage: s = TN/(TN+FP), so k=TN, l=FP
    * Accuracy: acc = TP+TN/(TP+TN+FP+FN), so k=TP+TN, l=FP+FN
    * Jaccard: j = TP/(TP+FP+FN), so k=TP, l=FP+FN

    .. note:: **Important**

       To calculate the limits given the required coverage, we use the
       incomplete **inverse** (regularized, or normalized) beta function,
       :any:`scipy.special.betaincinv` instead of :any:`scipy.special.betainc`.
       The latter requires we provide the bounds and returns the coverage,
       whereas here we are interested in the *inverse* behaviour.

    Parameters
    ----------
    successes
        Number of successes (``k``) observed on the experiment.
    failures
        Number of failures (``l``) observed on the experiment.

    coverage
        A floating-point number between 0 and 1.0 indicating the

        is covered by the returned equal-tailed interval.

    Returns
    -------
        A tuple containing 4 floating point numbers representing:

        * lower: The lower bounds of the credible region

    r"""Compare 2 system (binary) outputs using a Dirichlet posterior.

    This function returns the empyrical probability that a system (1) is better
    another system (2), based on their binary outputs.  The comparison is
    carried-out as described in [GOUTTE-2005]_, equations 16 and 19, via a
    Monte-Carlo simulation, since the integral of the probability cannot be
    resolved analytically.

    To do so, we compute the probability that :math:`P(\pi_1 > \pi_2)`, i.e.,
    the probability that system 1 gives the expected output while system 2 does
    not, is greater than the probability that system 1 is incorrect while
    system 2 gives the correct answer.  It assumes, therefore, systems 1 and 2
    are tuned (thresholded), and provide binary outputs that can be compared to
    generate 3 numbers:

    * :math:`n_1`: The measured number of times system 1 provides the correct
      answer, whereas system 2 does not
    * :math:`n_2`: The measured number of times system 2 provides the correct
      answer, whereas system 1 does not
    * :math:`n_3`: The measured number of times system 1 and 2 agree, giving
      the same answer (wrong or write, it does not matter)

    Notice that :math:`\pi_1 = \frac{n_1}{n_1 + n_2 + n_3}`, and so,
    analogously, you may calculate :math:`\pi_2` and :math:`\pi_3`.

    We then plug these numbers to simulate a Dirichlet (generalisation of the
    Beta distribution for multiple variables) by setting:

    * :math:`\alpha_1 = n_1 + \lambda_1`
    * :math:`\alpha_2 = n_2 + \lambda_2`
    * :math:`\alpha_3 = n_2 + \lambda_3`

    Where each :math:`\lambda_i` correspond to the prior to be imputed to that
    particular variable.  We typically select :math:`\lambda_1 = \lambda_2`,

    Parameters
    ----------
    n
        A triple with 3 integers representing :math:`n_1`, :math:`n_2` and
        :math:`n_3`.
    lambda_
        A tuple with length 3, containing floating point numbers describing the
        parameterisation of the Dirichlet priors to consider.  Use
        :math:`\lambda_i=0.5` for Jeffrey's prior.
    nb_samples
        Number of generated dirichlet distribution values (make this high, for
        a higher precision on the simulation).
    rng
        An initialized numpy random number generator.

    Returns
    -------
        probability: A number between 0.0 and 1.0 that describes the
        probability that the first system is better than the second one.
