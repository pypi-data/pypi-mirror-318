# STARS (Spatial Transcriptomics across Any Resolution for Single Cells)

**STARS** (Spatial Transcriptomics across Any Resolution for Single Cells) is a Python package for the analysis of spatial transcriptomics data. It decodes true single-cell gene expression from multicellular or subcellular resolution platforms, combining **Vision Transformer models** and **contrastive learning** to integrate histology images and spot-level transcriptomics data.

**STARS** provides high-resolution analysis from tissue-wide to individual cell levels and is validated on datasets from various spatial transcriptomics platforms such as **Visium**, **Visium HD**, and **Stereo-seq**.

## Features

- **Single-Cell Gene Expression Decoding**: From subcellular or multicellular platforms.
- **High-Resolution Integration**: Combines histology images with transcriptomics data.
- **Vision Transformer Models**: For robust spatial decoding.
- **Contrastive Learning**: To improve model accuracy and generalization.
- **Supports Multiple Platforms**:
  - **Visium**
  - **Visium HD**
  - **Stereo-seq**
- **Flexible Analysis Levels**: Works at tissue, individual cell, and molecular levels.

## Installation

To install **STARS**, use the following pip command:

```bash
pip install stars-omics
