    Creates an insecure channel from server address and connects.

    We allow the created channel to have un-bounded message lengths, to support
    large observations.

    Args:
      server_address: URI server address to connect to.
      timeout: Optional timeout in seconds to wait for channel to be ready.
        Default to waiting indefinitely.
      metadata: Optional sequence of 2-tuples, sent to the gRPC server as
          metadata.

    Returns:
      An instance of dm_env_rpc.Connection, where the channel is close upon the
      connection being closed.
