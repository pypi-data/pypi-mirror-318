**What is it?**

This repository (COSC425-DATA) is the host of the source code for the **Academic Metrics** package.

**Academic Metrics** is an AI-powered toolkit for collecting and classifying academic research publications.

The system:

- Collects publication data from Crossref API based on institutional affiliation
- Uses LLMs to classify research into NSF PhD research focus areas
- Extracts and analyzes themes and methodologies from abstracts
- Generates comprehensive analytics at article, author, and category levels
- Stores results in MongoDB (local or live via atlas), local JSON files, and optionally Excel files

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Automated fetching of publications via Crossref API
- **AI Classification**: LLM-powered analysis of research abstracts
- **Multi-level Analytics**:
  - Article-level metrics and classifications
  - Author/faculty publication statistics
  - Category-level aggregated data
- **Flexible Storage**: MongoDB integration, local JSON output, and optionally Excel files
- **Configurable Pipeline**: Customizable date ranges, models, and processing options
- **And more!**: There are many useful tools within the academic metrics package that can be used for much more than just classification of academic research data, and they're all quite intuitive to use. See [Other Uses](./additional_information/OtherUses.md) for more information.

## Documentation and example site built using the Salisbury University data from 2009-2024

To be able to see any and all implementation details from the code logic, structure, prompts, and more you can check out our documentation. The documentation is built with [*Sphinx*](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx), allowing for easy use and a sense of famliarity.

[**Academic Metrics Documentation**](https://cosc425-data.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

We also built an example site with the data we collected so that you can get a small idea of the potential uses for the data. This is by no means the only use case, but it does serve as a nice introduction to decide if this package would be useful for you.

> [!NOTE]
> The source code for the example site is available [here](https://github.com/cbarbes1/AITaxonomy-Front)

[**Example Site**](https://ai-taxonomy-front.vercel.app/)

> [!TIP]
> You can use our site source code for your own site!
> To easily launch your own website using the data you collect and classify via *Academic Metrics* see [**Site Creation Guide**](./additional_information/SiteCreationGuide.md)

## Installation and setup via pip

Hey all, we are pleased to announce as of January 1st, 2025, you can now install the *Academic Metrics* package via *pip* and easily run the system. Below are instructions outlining step by step how to do it.

### 0. External Setup

Recommended to use `python 3.12` as that is the version used for development and has not been tested on other versions.

Setting up mongod:

To see instructions on how to install and run mongod see the [MongoDB documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/).

If you have struggles setting up mongodb, google, youtube, and chatgpt are your friends.

The installation is rather easy, just follow the instructions and you should be able to get it running.

To find the name of your db you can run `mongosh` and then `show dbs` to see a list of all the databases on your server.

To create a new db with a custom name you can run `use <db_name>`.

Collection creation is handled by the system, you do not need to create them.

### 1. Installation and setup

Install `academic_metrics>=1.0.98` via pip.

To install the latest version of the package, you can run the following command:

```bash
pip install academic-metrics
```

**Virtual environment (Optional, but recommended):**

1. Create a virtual environment:

>[!NOTE]
> For these virtual environment examples we will be using `am_data_collection` as the name of the environment.

**venv**:

> [!NOTE]
> venv is of the form `python -m venv <env_name>`

```bash
python -m venv am_data_collection
```

**conda**:

> [!NOTE]
> conda is of the form
>
> `conda create -n <env_name> python=<python_version>`

```bash
conda create -n am_data_collection python=3.12
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

**venv**:

> [!NOTE]
> venv is of the form:
>
> `source <env_name>/bin/activate`

```bash
source am_data_collection/bin/activate
```

**conda**:

> [!NOTE]
> conda is of the form `conda activate <env_name>`

```bash
conda activate am_data_collection
```

### 2. Creating the directory and necessary files

1. Create the directory and navigate into it:

   For this example we will be using `am_data_collection` as the name of the directory, but you can name it whatever you want.

    **All systems (seperate commands):**

    ```bash
    mkdir am_data_collection
    cd am_data_collection
    ```

    Or as a single line:

    **Linux / Mac / Windows Command Prompt**:

    ```bash
    mkdir am_data_collection && cd am_data_collection
    ```

    **Windows Powershell**:

    ```powershell
    mkdir am_data_collection; cd am_data_collection
    ```

2. Create a `.env` file inside the directory you just created.

    **Linux/Mac**:

    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```

    **Windows** (Command Prompt):

    ```cmd
    type nul > .env
    ```

    **Windows** (PowerShell):

    ```powershell
    New-Item -Path .env -Type File
    ```

    You should now have a `.env` file in your directory.

### 3. Setting required environment variables

1. Open the `.env` file you just created, and add the following variables:

   - a variable to store your MongoDB URI, I recommend `MONGODB_URI`
   - a variable to store your database name, I recommend `DB_NAME`
   - a variable to store your OpenAI API Key, I recommend `OPENAI_API_KEY`

    After each variable you should add `=""` to the end of the variable.

    Once you've done this, your `.env` file should look something like this:

    ```python
    MONGODB_URI=""
    DB_NAME=""
    OPENAI_API_KEY=""
    ```

2. Retrieve and set your MongoDB URI:

    For local MongoDB it's typically:

    ```python
    MONGODB_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017"
    ```

    For live MongoDB:

    For a live version you should use the MongoDB Atlas URI. It should look something like this:

    ```bash
    mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-name>.<unique-id>.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=<YourAppNameOnAtlas>
    ```

    So in the `.env` file you should have something that looks like this:

    Local:

    ```python
    MONGODB_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017"
    ```

    Live:

    ```python
    MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-name>.<unique-id>.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=<YourAppNameOnAtlas>"
    ```

> [!WARNING]
> I recommend starting locally unless you need to use a live MongoDB instance.
> This will avoid the need to deal with setting up MongoDB Atlas, which while not difficult, it is an added step.

3. Set your database name

    You can pick any name you want for `DB_NAME`, but it needs to be a name of a valid database on your mongodb server. To make one on the command line you can run:

    ```bash
    mongosh
    use <db_name>
    ```

    For this demonstration we will be using `academic_metrics_data` as the `DB_NAME`.

    First we'll create the database on the command line:

    ```bash
    mongosh
    use academic_metrics_data
    ```

    This is to ensure the database actually exists so that the system can access it.

    Now that the database exists, we'll set the `DB_NAME` in the `.env` file.

    ```python
    DB_NAME="academic_metrics_data"
    ```

4. Set your OpenAI API Key

    If you do not have an OpenAI API key you will need to create one, but do not worry, it's easy.

    Go to the following link and click on "+ Create new secret key":

    [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

    Give the key a name, and then copy the key.

    Then in the `.env` file paste the key in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable.

    It should look similar to this, but with the full key instead of `sk-proj...`:

    ```python
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj..."
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You will need to add funds to your OpenAI account to use the API.
>
> When using the default model for the system (gpt-4o-mini), it cost us about $3-4 dollars to process all of the data from Salisbury University from 2009-2024.
>
> For larger models such as gpt-4o, the cost will be much higher.
>
> We saw good results using gpt-4o-mini, and it's also the most cost effective. So I recommend starting with that.
>
> Additionally, whether you opt to use our command line interface or your own script, the data is processed one month at a time and saved to the database, so if you run out of funds on your OpenAI account you will not lose data for the entire run, only the current month being processed. Simply add funds to your account and continue.
>
> You do not have to change anything in the code once you run it again, the system checks for existing data and only processes data that has not yet been processed.

All together your `.env` file should look like this:

```python
MONGODB_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017"
DB_NAME="academic_metrics_data"
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj..."
```

### 4. Quick Setup and Usage

For running the core system you have 2 options for how to do it.

1. Writing a short script (code provided) to loop over a range of dates you'd like to collect.
2. Using a provided function to run a command line interface version.

If you have experience with python, or don't mind learning a couple basics about loops, I recommend the first option.

If you do not have any experience with python or programming, and just want a plug and play solution, the second option works great.

Both options are simple to setup and use. I will detail the process for both options below. I suggest briefly reading through both options and then picking the one you prefer. Once you've picked one, simply follow the instructions for that option.

## Option 1 - Short Script

For this option you need to do the following:

1. Create the python file

    Within your directory, create a new python file, for this example we will be using `run_am.py`, but you can name it whatever you want.

    **Linux/Mac**:

    ```bash
    touch run_am.py
    ```

    **Windows (Command Prompt):**

    ```cmd
    type nul > run_am.py
    ```

    **Windows (PowerShell):**

    ```powershell
    New-Item -Path run_am.py -Type File
    ```

    You should now have a python file in your directory whose name matches the one you created.

2. Copy paste the following code into the file you just created:

    ```python

    # dotenv is the python package responsible for handling env files
    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    # os is used to get the environment variables from the .env file
    import os

    # PipelineRunner is the main class used to run the pipeline
    from academic_metrics.runners import PipelineRunner

    # load_dotenv is used to load the environment variables from the .env file
    load_dotenv()

    # Get the environment variables from the .env file
    ai_api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    mongodb_uri = os.getenv("MONGODB_URI")
    db_name = os.getenv("DB_NAME")

    # Set the date range you want to process
    # Years is a list of years as strings you want to process
    # Months is a list of strings representing the months you want processed for each year
    # For example if you want to process data from 2009-2024 for all months out of the year, you would do:
    # Note: the process runs left to right, so from beginning of list to the end of the list,
    # so this will process 2024, then 2023, then 2022, etc.
    # Data will be saved after each month is processed.
    years = [
        "2024",
        "2023",
        "2022",
        "2021",
        "2020",
        "2019",
        "2018",
        "2017",
        "2016",
        "2015",
        "2014",
        "2013",
        "2012",
        "2011",
        "2010",
        "2009",
    ]
    months = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "11", "12"]

    # Loop over the years and months and run the pipeline for each month
    # New objects are created for each month to avoid memory issues as well as to avoid overwriting data
    for year in years:
        for month in months:

            # Create a new PipelineRunner object for each month
            # parameters:
            # ai_api_key: the OpenAI API key
            # crossref_affiliation: the affiliation to use for the Crossref API
            # data_from_month: the month to start collecting data from
            # data_to_month: the month to end collecting data on
            # data_from_year: the year to start collecting data from
            # data_to_year: the year to end collecting data on
            # mongodb_url: the URL of the MongoDB server
            # db_name: the name of the database to use
            pipeline_runner = PipelineRunner(
                ai_api_key=ai_api_key,
                crossref_affiliation="Salisbury University",
                data_from_month=int(month),
                data_to_month=int(month),
                data_from_year=int(year),
                data_to_year=int(year),
                mongodb_uri=mongodb_uri,
                db_name=db_name,
            ) 

            # Run the pipeline for the current month
            pipeline_runner.run_pipeline()
    ```

    If you'd like to save the data to excel files in addition to the other data formats, you can do so via importing the function `get_excel_report` from `academic_metrics.runners` and calling it at the end of the script.

    Full code for convenience:

    ```python

    # dotenv is the python package responsible for handling env files
    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    # os is used to get the environment variables from the .env file
    import os

    # PipelineRunner is the main class used to run the pipeline
    # get_excel_report is the function used to save the data to excel files
    # it takes in a DatabaseWrapper object as a parameter, which connects to the database
    # and retrives the data before writing it to 3 seperate excel files. One for each data type.
    from academic_metrics.runners import PipelineRunner, get_excel_report

    # DatabaseWrapper is the class used to connect to the database and retrieve the data
    from academic_metrics.DB import DatabaseWrapper

    # load_dotenv is used to load the environment variables from the .env file
    load_dotenv()

    # Get the environment variables from the .env file
    # If you used the same names as the ones in the examples, you can just copy paste these
    # if you used different names, you will need to change them to match the ones in your .env file
    ai_api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    mongodb_url = os.getenv("MONGODB_URI")
    db_name = os.getenv("DB_NAME")

    # Set the date range you want to process
    # Years is a list of years as strings you want to process
    # Months is a list of strings representing the months you want processed for each year
    # For example if you want to process data from 2009-2024 for all months out of the year, you would do:
    # Note: the process runs left to right, so from beginning of list to the end of the list,
    # so this will process 2024, then 2023, then 2022, etc.
    # Data will be saved after each month is processed.
    years = [
        "2024",
        "2023",
        "2022",
        "2021",
        "2020",
        "2019",
        "2018",
        "2017",
        "2016",
        "2015",
        "2014",
        "2013",
        "2012",
        "2011",
        "2010",
        "2009",
    ]
    months = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "11", "12"]

    # Loop over the years and months and run the pipeline for each month
    #
    # New objects are created for each month 
    # to avoid memory issues as well as to avoid overwriting data
    for year in years:
        for month in months:

            # Create a new PipelineRunner object for each month
            # parameters:
            # ai_api_key: the OpenAI API key
            # crossref_affiliation: the affiliation to use for the Crossref API
            # data_from_month: the month to start collecting data from
            # data_to_month: the month to end collecting data on
            # data_from_year: the year to start collecting data from
            # data_to_year: the year to end collecting data on
            # mongodb_url: the URL of the MongoDB server
            # db_name: the name of the database to use
            pipeline_runner = PipelineRunner(
                ai_api_key=ai_api_key,
                crossref_affiliation="Salisbury University",
                data_from_month=int(month),
                data_to_month=int(month),
                data_from_year=int(year),
                data_to_year=int(year),
                mongodb_uri=mongodb_uri,
                db_name=db_name,
            ) 

            # Run the pipeline for the current month
            pipeline_runner.run_pipeline()

    # Create a new DatabaseWrapper object so it can be given to get_excel_report
    db = DatabaseWrapper(db_name=db_name, mongo_uri=mongodb_uri)

    # Call the get_excel_report function, passing in the db object, to save the data to excel files
    #
    # Once this finishes running, you should have 3 excel files in your directory:
    # article_data.xlsx, author_data.xlsx, and category_data.xlsx
    get_excel_report(db)
    ```

3. Run the script

    ```bash
    python run_am.py
    ```

    If you get the following error:

    ```bash
    'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
    ```

    Then it's likely one of the following issues, I recommend checking the following in order:

    - Try using `python3` instead of `python`
    - Make sure python is installed on your system
    - Make sure python is added to your system path, to see how to do this, you can look [here](https://realpython.com/add-python-to-path/)

    The latter two are likely not to be the issue, as you would've ran into them when setting up your virtual environment, but if the first does not fix the issue, then check the other two.

## Option 2 - Command Line Interface

For this options you will still need to create a python file, but the code will only be a couple lines long as you'll be passing in your arguments via the command line.

1. Create the python file

    Within your directory, create a new python file, for this example we will be using `run_am.py`, but you can name it whatever you want.

    **Linux/Mac**:

    ```bash
    touch run_am.py
    ```

    **Windows (Command Prompt):**

    ```cmd
    type nul > run_am.py
    ```

    **Windows (PowerShell):**

    ```powershell
    New-Item -Path run_am.py -Type File
    ```

    You should now have a python file in your directory whose name matches the one you created.

2. Copy and paste the following code into the file you just created:

    ```python
    from academic_metrics.runners import command_line_runner

    command_line_runner()
    ```

> [!WARNING]
> If you did not use the `MONGODB_URI` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` as the variable names in the .env file, you will need to make a couple changes to the above code.

**How to use with different variable names:**

The `command_line_runner` functions takes in 2 optional arguments, `openai_api_key_env_var_name` and `mongodb_uri_env_var_name` corresponding to the names of the environment variables you used in your .env file.

To use the different names, do the following:

```python
from academic_metrics.runners import command_line_runner

# The strings should be changes to match the names you used in your .env file
command_line_runner(
    openai_api_key_env_var_name="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_ENV_VAR_NAME",
    mongodb_uri_env_var_name="YOUR_MONGODB_URI_ENV_VAR_NAME",
)
```

1. Run the script

For this option you will still run the script from command line, but you will also be passing in arguments, details laid out below.

There are various command line arguments you can pass in, almost all are detailed here, but to complete list you can run:

```bash
python run_am.py --help
```

To run it, you can use the following arguments:

- `--from-month` - The month to start collecting data from, defaults to 1
- `--to-month` - The month to end collecting data on, defaults to 12
- `--from-year` - The year to start collecting data from, defaults to 2024
- `--to-year` - The year to end collecting data on, defaults to 2024
- `--db-name` - The name of the database to use (required)
- `--crossref-affiliation` - The affiliation to use for the Crossref API, defaults to Salisbury University (required)

If you want to save the data to excel files you can pass in the `--as-excel` argument.

>[!NOTE]
> The `--as-excel` argument is an additional action, it doesn't remove the the saving to other data formats, but merely adds the excel saving functionality.

### Examples

Say you want to collect data for every month from 2019 to 2024 for Salisbury University and save it to excel files. You would run the following command:

```bash
python run_am.py --from-month=1 \
--to-month=12 \
--from-year=2019 \
--to-year=2024 \
--crossref-affiliation="Salisbury University" \
--as-excel \
--db-name=Your_Database_Name
```

The default AI model used for all parts is `gpt-4o-mini`. If you want to use a different model you can use the following arguments:

- `--pre-classification-model` - The model to use for the pre-classification step
- `--classification-model` - The model to use for the classification step
- `--theme-model` - The model to use for the theme extraction step

>[!WARNING]
> This process consumes a lot of tokens, during testing we found that using `gpt-4o-mini` was the most cost effective and provided good results.
>
> If you want to use a larger model like `gpt-4o` you can do so, but be warned it will run through your tokens very quickly.
>
> If you do use a larger model I recommend you start with a smaller date range and work your way up.

Here's how you would run the pipeline using the larger `gpt-4o` model:

```bash
python run_am.py --from-month=1 \
--to-month=12 \
--from-year=2019 \
--to-year=2024 \
--crossref-affiliation="Salisbury University" \
--as-excel \
--db-name=Your_Database_Name \
--pre-classification-model=gpt-4o \
--classification-model=gpt-4o \
--theme-model=gpt-4o
```
