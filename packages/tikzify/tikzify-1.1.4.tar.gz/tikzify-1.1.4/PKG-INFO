A set of utilities for programmatically generating TikZ code.

Contribution guidelines
=======================

- Conventions

  - Naming conventions are according to PEP8.

- How to clean the source:

  - :bash:`ruff .`
  - :bash:`pyright`
  - :bash:`mypy`
  - :bash:`isort .`
  - :bash:`pylint tikzify`

Running
=======

- This macro is helpful for running examples:

.. code-block:: bash

    function dm {
        python "$1.py" $2 && pdflatex -shell-escape $1 && open $1.pdf
    }

- The basal ganglia example can be run by doing :bash:`dm basal_ganglia` from the examples folder.  It should produce :bash:`examples/basal_ganglia.pdf`, which shows all of the output, as well as :bash:`examples/figures/basal_ganglia-*.pdf`, which are the individual diagrams to be included.

- A copy of the `pdf <examples/basal_ganglia.pdf>` is provided.  It shows three programmatically-generated diagrams, with various sections highlighted.
