            code(s) for and where to send the email, if desired.
        :param code_store_function: The function to store the new
            authorization code associated with the email. This can be a
            callable function or a string.

            At a minimum, a callable function should take 'code' as
            an argument.
            A callable function can return an error message.

            The current pre-defined function types are:
                'bigquery': Saves the credentials to a BigQuery table.

            This is only necessary if you want to save the code to
            a database or other storage location. This can be useful so
            that you can confirm the code is saved during the
            callback and handle that as necessary.
        :param code_store_args: Arguments for the code_store_function.
            This should not include 'email' as that will automatically be
            added here based on the input variable. Instead, it should
            include things like database name, table name, credentials to
            log into the database, etc. That way they can be compiled in
            this function and passed to the function in the callback.

            If using 'bigquery' as your code_store_function, the
            following arguments are required:

            bq_creds (dict): Your credentials for BigQuery, such as a
                service account key (which would be downloaded as JSON and
                then converted to a dict before using them here).

                BigQuery table is located.
            dataset (str): The name of the dataset in the BigQuery table.
            table_name (str): The name of the table in the BigQuery
                dataset.
            email_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the emails.
            code_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the authorization codes.
        :param email_function:  Provide the method for email here, this
            can be a callable function or a string. The function can also
            return an error message as a string, which will be handled by
            the error handler.

            The current pre-defined function types are:

            "gmail": the user wants to use their Gmail account to send
                the email and must have the gmail API enabled. Note that
                this only works for local / desktop apps. If using this

                variable, as parts of the gmail_creds input.
                https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides
            "sendgrid": the user wants to use the SendGrid API to send
                the email. Note that you must have signed up for a
                SendGrid account and have an API key. If using this

            necessary if email_function is not None.

            If email_function = 'gmail':
                oauth2_credentials_secrets_dict (dict): The dictionary of
                    the client secrets. Note that putting the secrets file
                    in the same directory as the script is not secure.
                oauth2_credentials_token_file_name (str): Optional. The
                    name of the file to store the token, so it is not
                    necessary to reauthenticate every time. If left out,
                    it will default to 'token.json'.
            If email_function = 'sendgrid':
                sendgrid_api_key (str): The API key for the SendGrid API.
                    Note that it should be stored separately in a secure
                    location, such as a Google Cloud Datastore or
                    encrypted in your project's pyproject.toml file.

                        # you might also need credentials to connect to
                        # the client if not run on Google App Engine (or
                        # another service that recognizes the credentials
                        # automatically)

        Pulls the query params from the current URL, checks the email_code
        and optionally stores whether the email has been verified.

        :param email_code_pull_function: The function to pull the hashed
            email code associated with the email. This can be a
            callable function or a string.

            At a minimum, a callable function should take 'email_address'
            as an argument, but can include other arguments as well.
            A callable function should return:
             - A tuple of an indicator and a value
             - The indicator should be either 'dev_error', 'user_error'
                or 'success'.
             - The value should be a string that contains the error
                message when the indicator is 'dev_error', None when the
                indicator is 'user_error', and the hashed email
                code when the indicator is 'success'. It is None with
                'user_error' since we will handle that in the calling
                function and create a user_error that tells the user that
                the email or authorization code is incorrect.

            The current pre-defined function types are:
                'bigquery': Pulls the email code from a BigQuery table.
        :param email_code_pull_args: Arguments for the
            email_code_pull_function. This should not include
            'email_address' since that will automatically be added here
            based on the input.

            If using 'bigquery' as your email_code_pull_function, the
            following arguments are required:

            bq_creds (dict): Your credentials for BigQuery, such as a
                service account key (which would be downloaded as JSON and
                then converted to a dict before using them here).
            project (str): The name of the Google Cloud project where the
                BigQuery table is located.
            dataset (str): The name of the dataset in the BigQuery table.
            table_name (str): The name of the table in the BigQuery
                dataset.
            email_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the emails.
            email_code_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the email codes.
        :param verified_store_function: The function to store an indicator
            that the email was verified. This can be a callable function
            or a string.

            At a minimum, a callable function should take 'verified' as
            an argument.
            A callable function can return an error message.

            The current pre-defined function types are:
                'bigquery': Saves the verification to a BigQuery table.

            This is only necessary if you want to save the code to
            a database or other storage location. This can be useful so
            that you can confirm the email is verified when logging the
            user in.
        :param verified_store_args: Arguments for the
            verified_store_function. This should not include 'verified' as
            that will automatically be added here based on the result of
            checking the email code. Instead, it should include things
            like database name, table name, credentials to log into the
            database, etc. That way they can be compiled in this function
            and passed to the function in the callback.

            If using 'bigquery' as your verified_store_function, the
            following arguments are required:

            bq_creds (dict): Your credentials for BigQuery, such as a
                service account key (which would be downloaded as JSON and
                then converted to a dict before using them here).

            table_name (str): The name of the table in the BigQuery
                dataset.
            email_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the emails.
            verified_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the verification indicator.
            datetime_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the datetime. This is used to track
                when the verification was updated.
