        The only testing that has been done was using the Google OAuth2
        flow. This requires enabling the gmail API, consenting to OAuth2
        and allowing external users with the desired "from" email address
        as an authorized user, and creating credentials to use to connect
        to the gmail API. See the following links for more information:
        https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python#step_3_set_up_the_sample
        https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides/sending
        Note that the credentials are stored in a file called "token.json"
        and the first time this is run, the user will be prompted to
        consent to the OAuth2 flow. After that, the token will be stored
        and the user will not be prompted again, but if the token expires,
        the user will be prompted again. This is not a real problem for a
        developer with access to the gmail account, but would be a problem
        for an end user.

        In the future, we may want to test using a service account through
        Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) that has delegated authority
        to send emails on behalf of another account. This has not been
        tested, but if it works, the service account and OAuth methods
        could be moved into this method with options for gathering either
        set of credentials.
        See here for more details on the service accounts:
