            usernames_session_state]). These should be saved into the
            session state before instantiating this class. We use session
            state since we want to be able to update the list of usernames
            with the methods of this class and want the updated list to
            persist.
        :param emails_session_state: The session state name to access the
            LIST of existing emails (st.session_state[
            emails_session_state]). These should be saved into the session
            state before instantiating this class. We use session state

            with the methods of this class and want the updated list to

        :param user_credentials_session_state: The session state name to
            access the DICTIONARY of user credentials as
            {'username': username, 'email': email, 'password': password},
            with username and email encrypted and password hashed
            (st.session_state[user_credentials_session_state]). These
            are defined within the methods of this class and do not need
            to be saved into the session state before instantiating this
            class. We use session state since we want to be able to update
            the dictionary of user credentials with the methods of this
            class and want the updated dictionary to persist.
        :param preauthorized_session_state: The session state name to
            access the LIST of emails of unregistered users authorized to
            register (st.session_state[preauthorized_session_state]).
            These should be saved into the session state before
            instantiating this class. We use session state since we want
            to be able to update the list of emails with the methods of
            this class and want the updated list to persist. Can set this
            to None to ignore this feature.
        :param weak_passwords: The list of weak passwords that shouldn't
            be used. This isn't required, but is recommended.
        :param email_function: If we want to email the user after
            registering or updating their info, provide the method for
            email here, this can be a callable function or a string. The
            function can also return an error message as a string,
            which will be handled by the error handler.

            This variable is only necessary if you want to email the user
            in all cases and use the same method for emailing in each
            case. Otherwise, you can specify the email method in each
            individual function below.

            The current pre-defined function types are:

            "gmail": the user wants to use their Gmail account to send
                the email and must have the gmail API enabled. Note that
                this only works for local / desktop apps. If using this
                method, you must supply the
                oauth2_credentials_secrets_dict variable and
                optionally the oauth2_credentials_token_file_name
                variable, as parts of the gmail_creds input.
                https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides
            "sendgrid": the user wants to use the SendGrid API to send
                the email. Note that you must have signed up for a
                SendGrid account and have an API key. If using this
                method, you must supply the API key as the sendgrid_creds
                input here.
        :param email_inputs: The inputs for the email sending process.
            Only necessary for when email_function is not None.
            These are generic for any email method and currently include:

            website_name (str): The name of the website where the
                registration is happening.
            website_email (str) : The email that is sending the
                registration confirmation.

                Note that additional arguments will be specified in the
                individual methods below, such as the verification URL.
                You can also specify any of these arguments in the
                individual methods below, and they will override the ones
                specified here.
        :param email_creds: The credentials to use for the email API. Only
            necessary if email_function is not None.

            If email_function = 'gmail':
                oauth2_credentials_secrets_dict (dict): The dictionary of
                    the client secrets. Note that putting the secrets file
                    in the same directory as the script is not secure.
                oauth2_credentials_token_file_name (str): Optional. The
                    name of the file to store the token, so it is not
                    necessary to reauthenticate every time. If left out,
                    it will default to 'token.json'.
            If email_function = 'sendgrid':
                sendgrid_api_key (str): The API key for the SendGrid API.
                    Note that it should be stored separately in a secure
                    location, such as a Google Cloud Datastore or
                    encrypted in your project's pyproject.toml file.

                    Example code to get the credentials in Google Cloud
                        DataStore (you must install google-cloud-datastore
                        in your environment):
                        from google.cloud import datastore
                        # you can also specify the project and/or database
                        # in Client() below
                        # you might also need credentials to connect to
                        # the client if not run on Google App Engine (or
                        # another service that recognizes the credentials
                        # automatically)
                        client = datastore.Client()
                        # replace "apikeys" with the kind you set up in
                        # datastore
                        docs = list(client.query(kind="apikeys").fetch())
                        # replace "sendgridapikey" with the name of the
                        # key you set up in datastore
                        api_key = docs[0]["sendgridapikey"]
            Otherwise, these must be defined by the user in the callable
            function and will likely include credentials to the email
            service.
        :param save_pull_function: If you always want to use the same type
            of save or pull function, and that method is one of the
            built-in methods, you can specify that here.

            The current pre-defined types are:
                'bigquery': Saves and pulls from a BigQuery table.
        :param save_pull_args: If you have defined a save_pull_function,
            you can specify the arguments that are consistent for all
            methods here. This is a dictionary of the arguments that are
            passed to the save_pull_function.

            If save_pull_function = 'bigquery':
                bq_creds (dict): Your credentials for BigQuery, such as a
                    service account key (which would be downloaded as JSON
                    and then converted to a dict before using them here).
                project (str): The name of the Google Cloud project where
                    the BigQuery dataset is located. This should already
                    exist in GCP and have the BigQuery API enabled.
                dataset (str): The name of the dataset in BigQuery.
                    This should already have been created in BigQuery.

                Note that additional arguments will be specified in the
                individual methods below, such as the table or column
                names. You can also specify any of these arguments in the
                individual methods below, and they will override the ones
                specified here.

            used for things like accessing and pulling from a database.
            At a minimum, a callable function should take 'email' as
            one of the locked_info_args, but can include other arguments
            as well.
            A callable function should return:

                    database functions, you should also be using the
                    'bigquery' option or using your own method that writes

            This should not include 'email' since that will

            like database name, table name, credentials to log into the
            database, etc.

            If using 'bigquery' as your locked_info_function, the

                BigQuery table is located.
            dataset (str): The name of the dataset in the BigQuery table.

            locked_time_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the locked_times.
        :return: Tuple with the first value as True if the data was pulled
            and False if there was an error, and the second value will be
            latest_lock_datetime if the data was pulled successfully,

        :param store_function: The function to store the locked datetime
            associated with the email. Thi can be a callable function or a
            string.

            The function should pull in store_args, which can be used for
            things like accessing and storing to a database. At a minimum,
            a callable function should take 'email' as one of the
            store_args, but can include other arguments as well. A
            callable function can return an error message as a string,
            which our error handler will handle.

            The current pre-defined function types are:
                'bigquery': Stores the locked datetime to a BigQuery
                    table. This pre-defined version will look for a table
                    with two columns corresponding to email and
                    locked_time (see store_args below for how to define
                    there).
                    Note that if using 'bigquery' here, in our other
                    database functions, you should also be using the
                    'bigquery' option or using your own method that pulls
                    from a table set up in the same way.
        :param store_args: Arguments for the store_function. This should
            not include 'email' since that will automatically be added
            here. Instead, it should include things like database name,
            table name, credentials to log into the database, etc.

            If using 'bigquery' as your store_function, the following
            arguments are required:

            bq_creds (dict): Your credentials for BigQuery, such as a
                service account key (which would be downloaded as JSON and
                then converted to a dict before using them here).
            project (str): The name of the Google Cloud project where the
                BigQuery table is located.
            dataset (str): The name of the dataset in the BigQuery table.
            table_name (str): The name of the table in the BigQuery
                dataset.
            email_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the emails.
            locked_time_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the locked_times.

        :return: None if there is no error, a string error message if
            there is an error.

        If too many incorrect attempts occur at registration, the account

        This database pattern isn't required, but is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
        If not used, the session_state will still record incorrect
        registration attempts and if an account is locked, but that

        and the pattern of storing incorrect registration attempts to a
        database, as well as storing the times of an email being locked.
        If too many incorrect attempts occur at registration, the account
        is locked for locked_hours.
        Unlike with login, we don't have an unlock time, since that just
        means the user was able to register, which should only happen
        once.
        This database pattern isn't required, but is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
        If not used, the session_state will still record incorrect
        registration attempts and if an account is locked, but that
        can easily be disregarded by refreshing the website.
        Only necessary if preauthorization is True.

        Creates a new user registration widget.

        :param location: The location of the register new user form i.e.
            main or sidebar.
        :param display_errors: If True, display any errors that occur at
            the beginning and end of the method.
        :param preauthorization: The preauthorization requirement.
            True: user must be preauthorized to register.
            False: any user can register.
        :param verify_email: If True, the user must verify their email
            so we will create a random verification code. If saving the
            credentials, it can save there, as well as an indicator that
            the email is not yet verified.The user must also be emailed in
            this case and the email will contain a URL with the
            verification code as a parameter. Then you can verify this
            parameter using the verify_email method in Verification.
        :param email_text_key: The key for the email text input on the
            registration form. We attempt to default to a unique key, but
            you can put your own in here if you want to customize it or
            have clashes with other keys/forms.
        :param username_text_key: The key for the username text input on
            the registration form. We attempt to default to a unique key,
            but you can put your own in here if you want to customize it
            or have clashes with other keys/forms.
        :param password_text_key: The key for the password text input on
            the registration form. We attempt to default to a unique key,
            but you can put your own in here if you want to customize it
            or have clashes with other keys/forms.
        :param repeat_password_text_key: The key for the repeat password
            text input on the registration form. We attempt to default to
            a unique key, but you can put your own in here if you want to
            customize it or have clashes with other keys/forms.
        :param auth_code_key: The key for the authorization code text
            input on the registration form. We attempt to default to a
            unique key, but you can put your own in here if you want to
            customize it or have clashes with other keys/forms.
        :param email_function: If we want to email the user after
            registering, provide the method for email here, this can be a
            callable function or a string. The function can also return an
            error message as a string, which will be handled by the error
            handler.

            Only necessary if a) we want to email the user and b)
            email_function was not defined in the class instantiation. If
            we defined the email method in the class instantiation and we
            provide another here, the one here will override the one in
            the class instantiation. This is required if we set
            verify_email to True.

            The current pre-defined function types are:

            "gmail": the user wants to use their Gmail account to send
                the email and must have the gmail API enabled. Note that
                this only works for local / desktop apps. If using this
                method, you must supply the
                oauth2_credentials_secrets_dict variable and
                optionally the oauth2_credentials_token_file_name
                variable, as parts of the gmail_creds input.
                https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides
            "sendgrid": the user wants to use the SendGrid API to send
                the email. Note that you must have signed up for a
                SendGrid account and have an API key. If using this
                method, you must supply the API key as the sendgrid_creds
                input here.
        :param email_inputs: The inputs for the email sending process.
            Only necessary for when email_function is not None.
            These are generic for any email method and currently include:

            website_name (str): The name of the website where the
                registration is happening.
            website_email (str) : The email that is sending the
                registration confirmation.
            verification_url (str): The base email for verification, not
                including the verification code parameter. Required if
                verify_email is True. For example, it could be something
                like 'www.verifymyemail.com'. We will add the
                verification code. Note that for st.query_params to pull
                out the query parameters, we need the url to end without
                a "/", so we remove any trailing "/".
        :param email_creds: The credentials to use for the email API. Only
            necessary if email_function is not None.

            If email_function = 'gmail':
                oauth2_credentials_secrets_dict (dict): The dictionary of
                    the client secrets. Note that putting the secrets file
                    in the same directory as the script is not secure.
                oauth2_credentials_token_file_name (str): Optional. The
                    name of the file to store the token, so it is not
                    necessary to reauthenticate every time. If left out,
                    it will default to 'token.json'.
            If email_function = 'sendgrid':
                sendgrid_api_key (str): The API key for the SendGrid API.
                    Note that it should be stored separately in a secure
                    location, such as a Google Cloud Datastore or
                    encrypted in your project's pyproject.toml file.

                    Example code to get the credentials in Google Cloud
                        DataStore (you must install google-cloud-datastore
                        in your environment):
                        from google.cloud import datastore
                        # you can also specify the project and/or database
                        # in Client() below
                        # you might also need credentials to connect to
                        # the client if not run on Google App Engine (or
                        # another service that recognizes the credentials
                        # automatically)
                        client = datastore.Client()
                        # replace "apikeys" with the kind you set up in
                        # datastore
                        docs = list(client.query(kind="apikeys").fetch())
                        # replace "sendgridapikey" with the name of the
                        # key you set up in datastore
                        api_key = docs[0]["sendgridapikey"]
            Otherwise, these must be defined by the user in the callable
            function and will likely include credentials to the email
            service.
        :param cred_save_function: A function (callable) or pre-defined
            function type (str) to save the credentials.

            The current pre-defined function types are:
                'bigquery': Saves the credentials to a BigQuery table.

            Only necessary if a) we want to save the credentials and b)
            the save_pull_function variable was not defined in the class
            instantiation. If we defined the save_pull_function method in
            the class instantiation and we provide a value here, the one
            here will override the one in the class instantiation.

            This is only necessary if you want to save the credentials to
            a database or other storage location. This can be useful so
            that you can confirm the credentials are saved during the
            callback and handle that as necessary. The function should
            take the user credentials as an argument and save them to the
            desired location. However, those user credentials should not
            be defined in the cred_save_args (see below), since they will
            be created and automatically added here. Instead, it should
            take things like database name, table name, credentials to log
            into the database, etc. The function can also return an error
            message as a string, which will be handled by the error
            handler.
        :param cred_save_args: Arguments for the cred_save_function. Only
            necessary if cred_save_function is not None. Note that these
            arguments should NOT include the user credentials themselves,
            as these will be passed to the function automatically.
            Instead, it should include things like database name, table
            name, credentials to log into the database, etc. That way they
            can be compiled in this function and passed to the function in
            the callback. The variable for the cred_save_function for the
            user credentials should be called 'user_credentials'.

            If using 'bigquery' as your cred_save_function, the following
            arguments are required:

            bq_creds (dict): Your credentials for BigQuery, such as a
                service account key (which would be downloaded as JSON and
                then converted to a dict before using them here).
            project (str): The name of the Google Cloud project where the
                BigQuery table is located. This should already exist in
                GCP and have the BigQuery API enabled.
            dataset (str): The name of the dataset in the BigQuery table.
                This should already have been created in BigQuery.
            table_name (str): The name of the table in the BigQuery
                dataset. This does not need to have been created yet in
                the project/dataset. If not, a new table will be created;
                if so, it will be appended to.

            Note that bq_creds, project and dataset could be defined in
            the class instantiation, although they can be overwritten
            here. table_name must be defined here.
        :param auth_code_pull_function: The function to pull the
            authorization code associated with the email. This can be a
            callable function or a string.

            Only necessary if preauthorization is True.

            Only necessary to define here if the save_pull_function was
            not defined in the class instantiation. But if defined here,
            it will override the class instantiation.

            At a minimum, a callable function should take 'email' as
            an argument, but can include other arguments as well.
            A callable function should return:
             - A tuple of an indicator and a value
             - The indicator should be either 'dev_error', 'user_error'
                or 'success'.
             - The value should be a string that contains the error
                message when the indicator is 'dev_error', None when the
                indicator is 'user_error', and the hashed password when
                the indicator is 'success'. It is None with 'user_error'
                since we will handle that in the calling function and
                create a user_errors that tells the user that the
                email or authorization code was incorrect.

            The current pre-defined function types are:
                'bigquery': Pulls the code from a BigQuery table. It
                    performs a basic SQL lookup to see if there are any
                    codes associated with the given email and, if
                    so, returns that (hashed) code.
        :param auth_code_pull_args: Arguments for the
            auth_code_pull_function.

            Only necessary if auth_code_pull_function is defined when you
            call this method.

            If using 'bigquery' as your auth_code_pull_function, the
            following arguments are required:

            bq_creds (dict): Your credentials for BigQuery, such as a
                service account key (which would be downloaded as JSON and
                then converted to a dict before using them here).
            project (str): The name of the Google Cloud project where the
                BigQuery table is located.
            dataset (str): The name of the dataset in the BigQuery table.
            table_name (str): The name of the table in the BigQuery
                dataset.
            email_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the emails.
            auth_code_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the authorization codes.

            Note that bq_creds, project and dataset could be defined in
            the class instantiation, although they can be overwritten
            here. table_name, email_col and auth_code_col must be
            defined here.
        :param incorrect_attempts: The number of incorrect attempts
            allowed before the account is locked. Only necessary if
            preauthorization is True.
        :param locked_hours: The number of hours the account is locked
            after exceeding the number of incorrect attempts. Only
            necessary if preauthorization is True.

        The following parameters are all associated with preauthorization
        and the pattern of storing incorrect registration attempts to a
        database, as well as storing the times of an email being locked.
        If too many incorrect attempts occur at registration, the account
        is locked for locked_hours.
        Unlike with login, we don't have an unlock time, since that just
        means the user was able to register, which should only happen
        once.
        This database pattern isn't required, but is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
        If not used, the session_state will still record incorrect
        registration attempts and if an account is locked, but that
        can easily be disregarded by refreshing the website.
        Only necessary if preauthorization is True.

        :param all_locked_function: Since all the lock-type functions
            below behave similarly, you can define all of them at once
            here if the input is a string. For example, you could say
            all_locked_function='bigquery'. However, since each function
            behaves somewhat differently at the detailed level, you cannot
            supply a function here.

            This replaces the need to define locked_info_function and
            store_locked_time_function.

            Only necessary if the save_pull_function was not defined
            in the class instantiation. But if defined here, it will
            override the class instantiation.

            The current pre-defined function types are:
                'bigquery': Pulls and stores the locked datetimes from a
                BigQuery table.
        :param all_locked_args: If all_locked_function is defined, you
            can supply the arguments for the type of function here. For
            example, if using 'bigquery', you would supply:

            bq_creds (dict): Your credentials for BigQuery, such as a
                service account key (which would be downloaded as JSON and
                then converted to a dict before using them here).
            project (str): The name of the Google Cloud project where the
                BigQuery table is located.
            dataset (str): The name of the dataset in the BigQuery table.
            table_name (str): The name of the table in the BigQuery
                dataset.
            email_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the emails.
            locked_time_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the locked_times.

            Only necessary if all_locked_function is defined when you
            call this method.

            Note that bq_creds, project and dataset could be defined in
            the class instantiation, although they can be overwritten
            here. table_name, email_col and locked_time_col must be
            defined here.
        :param locked_info_function: The function to pull the locked
            information associated with the email. This can be a
            callable function or a string.

            Only necessary if both a) the save_pull_function was not
            defined in the class instantiation and b) all_locked_function
            was not defind in this method. But if defined here, it will
            override either of those.

            The function should pull in locked_info_args, which can be
            used for things like accessing and pulling from a database.
            At a minimum, a callable function should take 'email' as
            one of the locked_info_args, but can include other arguments
            as well.
            A callable function should return:
            - A tuple of an indicator and a value
            - The indicator should be either 'dev_error' or 'success'.
            - The value should be a string that contains the error
                message when the indicator is 'dev_error' and
                latest_lock_datetime when the indicator is 'success'.

            The current pre-defined function types are:
                'bigquery': Pulls the locked datetimes from a BigQuery
                    table.
                    This pre-defined version will look for a table with
                    two columns corresponding to email and locked_time
                    (see locked_info_args below for how to define there).
                    Note that if using 'bigquery' here, in our other
                    database functions, you should also be using the
                    'bigquery' option or using your own method that writes
                    to a table set up in the same way.
        :param locked_info_args: Arguments for the locked_info_function.
            This should not include 'email' since that will
            automatically be added here. Instead, it should include things
            like database name, table name, credentials to log into the
            database, etc.

            Only necessary if locked_info_function is defined when you
            call this method.

            If using 'bigquery' as your locked_info_function, the
            following arguments are required:

            bq_creds (dict): Your credentials for BigQuery, such as a
                service account key (which would be downloaded as JSON and
                then converted to a dict before using them here).

                BigQuery table is located.
            dataset (str): The name of the dataset in the BigQuery table.
            table_name (str): The name of the table in the BigQuery
                dataset.
            email_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the emails.
            locked_time_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the locked_times.

            Note that bq_creds, project and dataset could be defined in
            the class instantiation, although they can be overwritten
            here. table_name, email_col and locked_time_col must be
            defined here.
        :param store_locked_time_function: The function to store the
            locked datetime associated with the email. This can be a
            callable function or a string.

            Only necessary if both a) the save_pull_function was not
            defined in the class instantiation and b) all_locked_function
            was not defind in this method. But if defined here, it will
            override either of those.

            The function should pull in store_locked_time_args, which can

            as well. A callable function can return an error message
            as a string, which our error handler will handle.

            The current pre-defined function types are:
                'bigquery': Stores the locked datetime to a BigQuery
                    table. This pre-defined version will look for a table
                    with two columns corresponding to username and
                    locked_time (see store_locked_time_args below for how
                    to define there). Note that if using 'bigquery' here,
                    in our other database functions, you should also be
                    using the 'bigquery' option or using your own method

            information associated with the username. This can be a
            callable function or a string.

            The function should pull in locked_info_args, which can be
            used for things like accessing and pulling from a database.
            At a minimum, a callable function should take 'username' as
            one of the locked_info_args, but can include other arguments
            as well.
            A callable function should return:
            - A tuple of an indicator and a value
            - The indicator should be either 'dev_error' or 'success'.
            - The value should be a string that contains the error
                message when the indicator is 'dev_error' and a

                'bigquery': Pulls the locked and unlocked datetimes from a
                    BigQuery table.
                    This pre-defined version will look for a table with
                    three columns corresponding to username, locked_time
                    and unlocked_time (see locked_info_args below for how
                    to define there). If the account is locked, the latest
                    locked_time will be more recent than the latest
                    unlocked_time. Note that if using 'bigquery' here,
                    in our other database functions, you should
                    also be using the 'bigquery' option or using your own
                    method that writes to a table set up in the same way.
        :param locked_info_args: Arguments for the locked_info_function.
            This should not include 'username' since that will
            automatically be added here. Instead, it should include things
            like database name, table name, credentials to log into the
            database, etc.

            If using 'bigquery' as your locked_info_function, the
            following arguments are required:

            bq_creds (dict): Your credentials for BigQuery, such as a
                service account key (which would be downloaded as JSON and
                then converted to a dict before using them here).
            project (str): The name of the Google Cloud project where the
                BigQuery table is located.
            dataset (str): The name of the dataset in the BigQuery table.
            table_name (str): The name of the table in the BigQuery
                dataset.
            username_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the usernames.
            locked_time_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the locked_times.
            unlocked_time_col (str): The name of the column in the
                BigQuery table that contains the unlocked_times.

        :return: Tuple with the first value as True if the data was pulled
            and False if there was an error, and the second value will be
            a tuple of (latest_lock_datetime, latest_unlock_datetime) if
            the data was pulled successfully, and None if there was an

            At a minimum, a callable function should take 'username' as
            an argument, but can include other arguments as well.
            A callable function should return:
             - A tuple of an indicator and a value
             - The indicator should be either 'dev_error', 'user_error'
                or 'success'.
             - The value should be a string that contains the error

                indicator is 'user_error', and the hashed password when
                the indicator is 'success'. It is None with 'user_error'
                since we will handle that in the calling function and
                create a user_error that tells the user that
                the username or password is incorrect.

            The current pre-defined function types are:
                'bigquery': Pulls the password from a BigQuery table.
        :param check_email_verification: Whether to check if the user's
            email has been verified. This will happen within the same
            function as the password_pull_function, so you will need to
            incorporate any necessary arguments into password_pull_args.
            If writing your own function for password_pull_function, you
            should make sure to check the email verification if this is
            set to True.
        :param password_pull_args: Arguments for the
            password_pull_function. This should not include 'username'
            since that will automatically be added here based on the
            user's input.

            If using 'bigquery' as your password_pull_function, the
            following arguments are required:

            bq_creds (dict): Your credentials for BigQuery, such as a
                service account key (which would be downloaded as JSON and
                then converted to a dict before using them here).
            project (str): The name of the Google Cloud project where the
                BigQuery table is located.
            dataset (str): The name of the dataset in the BigQuery table.
            table_name (str): The name of the table in the BigQuery
                dataset.
            username_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the usernames.
            password_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the passwords.
            email_verification_col (str): Only necessary if the
                check_email_verification is set to True. The name of the
                column in the BigQuery table that contains the email
                verification status (True or False). The built-in
                BigQuery version assumes the email verification column is
                in the same table as the password. If not, you will need
                to build your own function to pull from separate places.

        :param username_or_email: The username or email to store the lock
            time for.
        :param store_incorrect_attempts_function: The function to store
            the datetime and username or email when an incorrect
            authorization attempt occurs. This can be a callable function
            or a string. At a minimum, a callable function should take
            'username_or_email' as an argument, but can include other
            arguments as well. The function should pull in
            store_incorrect_attempts_args, which can be used for things
            like accessing and storing to a database. A callable function
            can return an error message as a string, which our error
            handler will handle.

            The current pre-defined function types are:
                'bigquery': Stores the attempted datetime to a BigQuery
                    table. This pre-defined version will look for a table
                    with two columns corresponding to username or email
                    and datetime (see store_incorrect_attempts_args below
                    for how to define there).
                    Note that if using 'bigquery' here, in our other
                    database functions, you should also be using the
                    'bigquery' option or using your own method that pulls
                    from a table set up in the same way.
        :param store_incorrect_attempts_args: Arguments for the
            store_incorrect_attempts_function. This should not include
            'username_or_email' since that will automatically be added
            here. Instead, it should include things like database name,
            table name, credentials to log into the database, etc.

            If using 'bigquery' as your store_incorrect_attempts_function,
            the following arguments are required:

            bq_creds (dict): Your credentials for BigQuery, such as a
                service account key (which would be downloaded as JSON and
                then converted to a dict before using them here).
            project (str): The name of the Google Cloud project where the
                BigQuery table is located.
            dataset (str): The name of the dataset in the BigQuery table.
            table_name (str): The name of the table in the BigQuery
                dataset.
            username_col (str): The name of the column in the
                BigQuery table that contains the usernames.
            OR
            email_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the emails. The code will pull the
                correct version (username_col or email_col) depending on
                the auth_type variable.
            datetime_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the datetime.
        :param auth_type: The type of authentication that the incorrect
            attempt is associated with. This can be 'login' or
            'register_user'. Only required if
            store_incorrect_attempts_function is 'bigquery'.

        :return error: The error message if there is an error, otherwise
            None.

        Creates a login widget.

        Note that this method does not check for whether a user is already
        logged in, that should happen separately from this method, with
        this method one of the resulting options. For example:
        if check_authentication_status():
            main()
        else:
            stuser.login()

            sidebar.
        :param display_errors: If True, display any errors that occur at
            the beginning and end of the method.
        :param username_text_key: The key for the username text input on
            the login form. We attempt to default to a unique key, but you
            can put your own in here if you want to customize it or have
            clashes with other keys/forms.
        :param password_text_key: The key for the password text input on
            the login form. We attempt to default to a unique key, but you
            can put your own in here if you want to customize it or have
            clashes with other keys/forms.
        :param password_pull_function: The function to pull the password
            associated with the username. This can be a callable function
            or a string.

            Only necessary if the save_pull_function was not defined
            in the class instantiation. But if defined here, it will
            override the class instantiation.

            At a minimum, a callable function should take 'username' as
            an argument, but can include other arguments as well.
            A callable function should return:
             - A tuple of an indicator and a value
             - The indicator should be either 'dev_error', 'user_error'
                or 'success'.
             - The value should be a string that contains the error
                message when the indicator is 'dev_error', None when the
                indicator is 'user_error', and the hashed password when
                the indicator is 'success'. It is None with 'user_error'
                since we will handle that in the calling function and
                create a user_errors that tells the user that the
                username or password was incorrect.

            The current pre-defined function types are:
                'bigquery': Pulls the password from a BigQuery table. It
                    performs a basic SQL lookup to see if there are any
                    passwords associated with the given username and, if
                    so, returns that (hashed) password.
        :param check_email_verification: Whether to check if the user's
            email has been verified. This will happen within the same
            function as the password_pull_function, so you will need to
            incorporate any necessary arguments into password_pull_args.
            If writing your own function for password_pull_function, you
            should make sure to check the email verification if this is
            set to True.
        :param password_pull_args: Arguments for the
            password_pull_function.

            Only necessary if password_pull_function is defined when you
            call this method.

            If using 'bigquery' as your password_pull_function, the
            following arguments are required:

            bq_creds (dict): Your credentials for BigQuery, such as a
                service account key (which would be downloaded as JSON and
                then converted to a dict before using them here).
            project (str): The name of the Google Cloud project where the
                BigQuery table is located.
            dataset (str): The name of the dataset in the BigQuery table.
            table_name (str): The name of the table in the BigQuery
                dataset.
            username_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the usernames.
            password_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the passwords.
            email_verification_col (str): Only necessary if the
                check_email_verification is set to True. The name of the
                column in the BigQuery table that contains the email
                verification status (True or False). The built-in
                BigQuery version assumes the email verification column is
                in the same table as the password. If not, you will need
                to build your own function to pull from separate places.

            Note that bq_creds, project and dataset could be defined in
            the class instantiation, although they can be overwritten
            here. table_name, username_col and password_col must be
            defined here.
        :param incorrect_attempts: The number of incorrect attempts
            allowed before the account is locked.
        :param locked_hours: The number of hours the account is locked
            after exceeding the number of incorrect attempts.

        The following parameters are all associated with the pattern of
        storing incorrect login attempts to a database, as well as storing
        the times of a username being locked and unlocked. If the user
        successfully logs in, an unlocked time is added to the database,
        so that we know the account is currently unlocked. If too many
        incorrect attempts occur at logging in, the account is locked for
        locked_hours.
        This database pattern isn't required, but is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
        If not used, the session_state will still record incorrect login
        attempts and if an account is locked or not, but that can easily
        be disregarded by refreshing the website.

        :param all_locked_function: Since all the lock-type functions
            below behave similarly, you can define all of them at once
            here if the input is a string. For example, you could say
            all_locked_function='bigquery'. However, since each function
            behaves somewhat differently at the detailed level, you cannot
            supply a function here.

            This replaces the need to define locked_info_function,
            store_locked_time_function and store_unlocked_time_function.

            Only necessary if the save_pull_function was not defined
            in the class instantiation. But if defined here, it will
            override the class instantiation.

            The current pre-defined function types are:
                'bigquery': Pulls ans stores the locked and unlocked
                datetimes from a BigQuery table.
        :param all_locked_args: If all_locked_function is defined, you
            can supply the arguments for the type of function here. For
            example, if using 'bigquery', you would supply:

            bq_creds (dict): Your credentials for BigQuery, such as a
                service account key (which would be downloaded as JSON and
                then converted to a dict before using them here).
            project (str): The name of the Google Cloud project where the
                BigQuery table is located.
            dataset (str): The name of the dataset in the BigQuery table.
            table_name (str): The name of the table in the BigQuery
                dataset.
            username_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the usernames.
            locked_time_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the locked_times.
            unlocked_time_col (str): The name of the column in the
                BigQuery table that contains the unlocked_times.

            Only necessary if all_locked_function is defined when you
            call this method.

            Note that bq_creds, project and dataset could be defined in
            the class instantiation, although they can be overwritten
            here. table_name, username_col, locked_time_col and
            unlocked_time_col must be defined here.
        :param locked_info_function: The function to pull the locked
            information associated with the username. This can be a
            callable function or a string.

            Only necessary if both a) the save_pull_function was not
            defined in the class instantiation and b) all_locked_function
            was not defind in this method. But if defined here, it will
            override either of those.

            The function should pull in locked_info_args, which can be
            used for things like accessing and pulling from a database.
            At a minimum, a callable function should take 'username' as
            one of the locked_info_args, but can include other arguments
            as well.
            A callable function should return:
            - A tuple of an indicator and a value
            - The indicator should be either 'dev_error' or 'success'.
            - The value should be a string that contains the error
                message when the indicator is 'dev_error' and a
                tuple of (latest_lock_datetime, latest_unlock_datetime)
                when the indicator is 'success'.

            The current pre-defined function types are:
                'bigquery': Pulls the locked and unlocked datetimes from a
                    BigQuery table.
                    This pre-defined version will look for a table with
                    three columns corresponding to username, locked_time
                    and unlocked_time (see locked_info_args below for how
                    to define there). If the account is locked, the latest
                    locked_time will be more recent than the latest
                    unlocked_time. Note that if using 'bigquery' here,
                    in our other database functions, you should
                    also be using the 'bigquery' option or using your own
                    method that writes to a table set up in the same way.
        :param locked_info_args: Arguments for the locked_info_function.
            This should not include 'username' since that will
            automatically be added here. Instead, it should include things
            like database name, table name, credentials to log into the
            database, etc.

            Only necessary if locked_info_function is defined when you
            call this method.

            If using 'bigquery' as your locked_info_function, the
            following arguments are required:

            bq_creds (dict): Your credentials for BigQuery, such as a
                service account key (which would be downloaded as JSON and
                then converted to a dict before using them here).
            project (str): The name of the Google Cloud project where the
                BigQuery table is located.
            dataset (str): The name of the dataset in the BigQuery table.
            table_name (str): The name of the table in the BigQuery
                dataset.
            username_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the usernames.
            locked_time_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the locked_times.
            unlocked_time_col (str): The name of the column in the
                BigQuery table that contains the unlocked_times.

            Note that bq_creds, project and dataset could be defined in
            the class instantiation, although they can be overwritten
            here. table_name, username_col, locked_time_col and
            unlocked_time_col must be defined here.
        :param store_locked_time_function: The function to store the
            locked datetime associated with the username. This can be a
            callable function or a string.

            Only necessary if both a) the save_pull_function was not
            defined in the class instantiation and b) all_locked_function
            was not defind in this method. But if defined here, it will
            override either of those.

            The function should pull in store_locked_time_args, which can
            be used for things like accessing and storing to a database.
            At a minimum, a callable function should take 'username' as
            one of the locked_info_args, but can include other arguments
            as well. A callable function can return an error message
            as a string, which our error handler will handle.

            The current pre-defined function types are:
                'bigquery': Stores the locked datetime to a BigQuery
                    table. This pre-defined version will look for a table
                    with three columns corresponding to username,
                    locked_time and unlocked_time (see
                    store_locked_time_args below for how to define there).
                    Note that if using 'bigquery' here, in our other
                    database functions, you should also be using the
                    'bigquery' option or using your own method that pulls
                    from a table set up in the same way.

            since that will automatically be added here. Instead, it
            should include things like database name, table name,
            credentials to log into the database, etc.

            Only necessary if store_locked_time_function is defined when
            you call this method.

            If using 'bigquery' as your store_locked_time_function, the
            following arguments are required:

            bq_creds (dict): Your credentials for BigQuery, such as a
                service account key (which would be downloaded as JSON and
                then converted to a dict before using them here).
            project (str): The name of the Google Cloud project where the
                BigQuery table is located.
            dataset (str): The name of the dataset in the BigQuery table.
            table_name (str): The name of the table in the BigQuery
                dataset.
            username_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the usernames.
            locked_time_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the locked_times.
            unlocked_time_col (str): The name of the column in the
                BigQuery table that contains the unlocked_times.

            Note that bq_creds, project and dataset could be defined in
            the class instantiation, although they can be overwritten
            here. table_name, username_col, locked_time_col and
            unlocked_time_col must be defined here.
        :param store_unlocked_time_function: The function to store the
            unlocked times associated with the username. See
            store_locked_time_function above - this just stores the unlock
            time instead of the lock time.
        :param store_unlocked_time_args: Arguments for the
            store_unlocked_times_function. See
            store_locked_time_args above - these variable will be the same
            here.
        :param all_incorrect_attempts_function: Since all the
            incorrect attempts-type functions below behave similarly,
            you can define all of them at once here if the input is a
            string. For example, you could say
            all_incorrect_attempts_function='bigquery'. However, since
            each function behaves somewhat differently at the detailed
            level, you cannot supply a function here.

            This replaces the need to define
            store_incorrect_attempts_function and
            pull_incorrect_attempts_function.

            Only necessary if the save_pull_function was not defined
            in the class instantiation. But if defined here, it will
            override the class instantiation.

            The current pre-defined function types are:
                'bigquery': Pulls and stores the incorrect attempts from a
                    BigQuery table.
        :param all_incorrect_attempts_args: If
            all_incorrect_attempts_function is defined, you can supply the
            arguments for the type of function here. For example, if using
            'bigquery', you would supply:

            bq_creds (dict): Your credentials for BigQuery, such as a
                service account key (which would be downloaded as JSON and
                then converted to a dict before using them here).
            project (str): The name of the Google Cloud project where the
                BigQuery table is located.
            dataset (str): The name of the dataset in the BigQuery table.
            table_name (str): The name of the table in the BigQuery
                dataset.
            username_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the usernames.
            datetime_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the datetime.

            Note that bq_creds, project and dataset could be defined in
            the class instantiation, although they can be overwritten
            here. table_name, username_col and datetime_col must be
            defined here.
        :param store_incorrect_attempts_function: The function to store
            the datetime and username when an incorrect login attempt
            occurs. This can be a callable function or a string. At a
            minimum, a callable function should take 'username' as an
            argument, but can include other arguments as well. The
            function should pull in store_incorrect_attempts_args, which
            can be used for things like accessing and storing to a

                    with two columns corresponding to username and

                    in the same directory as the script is not secure.
                oauth2_credentials_token_file_name (str): Optional. The
                    name of the file to store the token, so it is not

                    Note that it should be stored separately in a secure
                    location, such as a Google Cloud Datastore or

                        api_key = docs[0]["sendgridapikey"]
            Otherwise, these must be defined by the user in the callable

        :param username_pull_function: The function to pull the
            username associated with the email. This can be a callable
            function or a string.

            At a minimum, a callable function should take 'email' as
            an argument, but can include other arguments as well.
            A callable function should return:
             - A tuple of an indicator and a value
             - The indicator should be either 'dev_error', 'user_error' or
                'success'
             - The value should be a string that contains the error
                message when the indicator is 'dev_error' and the username
                when the indicator is 'success'. The value associated with
                'user_error' isn't used as that is the case when the
                username does not exist in the system and we don't tell
                the user that.

            The current pre-defined function types are:
                'bigquery': Pulls the username from a BigQuery table.
        :param username_pull_args: Arguments for the
            username_pull_function. This should not include 'email'
            since that will automatically be added here based on the
            user's input.

            If using 'bigquery' as your username_pull_function, the
            following arguments are required:

            bq_creds (dict): Your credentials for BigQuery, such as a
                service account key (which would be downloaded as JSON and
                then converted to a dict before using them here).
            project (str): The name of the Google Cloud project where the
                BigQuery table is located.
            dataset (str): The name of the dataset in the BigQuery table.
            table_name (str): The name of the table in the BigQuery
                dataset.
            email_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the emails.
            username_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the usernames.
        :param password_store_function: The function to store the new
            password associated with the email and username. This can be a
            callable function or a string.

            At a minimum, a callable function should take 'password' as
            an argument, as well as 'username' since we can match against
            that.
            A callable function can return an error message.
             - If the password was successfully updated, the function
                should return None, as we don't want to give users too
                much info here.

            The current pre-defined function types are:
                'bigquery': Saves the credentials to a BigQuery table.

            This is only necessary if you want to save the password to
            a database or other storage location. This can be useful so
            that you can confirm the password is saved during the
            callback and handle that as necessary.
        :param password_store_args: Arguments for the
            password_store_function. This should not include 'username' or
            'password' as those will automatically be added here based on
            the user's input. Instead, it should include things like
            database name, table name, credentials to log into the
            database, etc. That way they can be compiled in this function
            and passed to the function in the callback.

            If using 'bigquery' as your password_store_function, the
            following arguments are required:

            bq_creds (dict): Your credentials for BigQuery, such as a
                service account key (which would be downloaded as JSON and
                then converted to a dict before using them here).
            project (str): The name of the Google Cloud project where the
                BigQuery table is located.
            dataset (str): The name of the dataset in the BigQuery table.
            table_name (str): The name of the table in the BigQuery
                dataset.
            username_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the usernames.
            password_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the passwords. The password associated
                with the given email and username will be overwritten with
                the new password.
            datetime_col (str): The name of the column in the BigQuery
                table that contains the datetime. This is used to track
                when the password was updated.
        :param email_function:  Provide the method for email here, this
            can be a callable function or a string. The function can also
            return an error message as a string, which will be handled by
            the error handler.

            The current pre-defined function types are:

            "gmail": the user wants to use their Gmail account to send
                the email and must have the gmail API enabled. Note that
                this only works for local / desktop apps. If using this
                method, you must supply the
                oauth2_credentials_secrets_dict variable and
                optionally the oauth2_credentials_token_file_name
                variable, as parts of the gmail_creds input.
                https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides
            "sendgrid": the user wants to use the SendGrid API to send
                the email. Note that you must have signed up for a
                SendGrid account and have an API key. If using this
                method, you must supply the API key as the sendgrid_creds
                input here.
        :param email_inputs: The inputs for the email sending process.
            These are generic for any email method and currently include:

            website_name (str): The name of the website where the
                registration is happening.
            website_email (str) : The email that is sending the
                registration confirmation.
        :param email_creds: The credentials to use for the email API. Only
            necessary if email_function is not None.

            If email_function = 'gmail':
                oauth2_credentials_secrets_dict (dict): The dictionary of

                when the indicator is 'success'. The value associated with

            password associated with the logged-in username. This can be a
            callable function or a string.

            At a minimum, a callable function should take 'info' as
            an argument, which is either 'email' or 'password' as the
            type of data to pull. It should also take 'username' as that
            is the username we will match to. And it can include other
            arguments as well.
            A callable function should return:
             - A tuple of an indicator and a value
             - The indicator should be either 'dev_error', 'user_error' or
                'success'
             - The value should be a string that contains the error
                message when the indicator is 'dev_error'  or 'user_error'
                and the email or password when the indicator is 'success'.

            The current pre-defined function types are:
                'bigquery': Pulls the info from a BigQuery table.
        :param info_pull_args: Arguments for the
            info_pull_function. This should not include 'info' or
            'username' since those will automatically be added here based
            on the user's inputs.

            If using 'bigquery' as your info_pull_function, the
            following arguments are required:

            bq_creds (dict): Your credentials for BigQuery, such as a
                service account key (which would be downloaded as JSON and
                then converted to a dict before using them here).
            project (str): The name of the Google Cloud project where the
                BigQuery table is located.
            dataset (str): The name of the dataset in the BigQuery table.
            table_name (str): The name of the table in the BigQuery
                dataset.
            col_map (dict): A dictionary mapping the info types to the
                associated column names in the database.
                {'email': email_col,
                 'username': username_col,
                 'password': password_col}
        :param info_store_function: The function to store the new email,
            username or password. This can be a callable function or a
            string.

            At a minimum, a callable function should take 'info' as
            an argument, as well as 'type' so we know where to look
            to update. For example, 'type' could be 'email', 'username'
            or 'password' and then the function can handle accordingly.
            A callable function can return an error message.
             - If the info was successfully updated, the function
                should return None, as we don't want to give users too
                much info here.

            The current pre-defined function types are:
                'bigquery': Saves the info to a BigQuery table.
        :param info_store_args: Arguments for the info_store_function.
            This should not include 'info' or 'type' as
            those will automatically be added here based on the user's
            input. Instead, it should include things like database
            name, table name, credentials to log into the database,
            etc. That way they can be compiled in this function and passed
            to the function in the callback.

            If using 'bigquery' as your info_store_function, the
            following arguments are required:

            bq_creds (dict): Your credentials for BigQuery, such as a
                service account key (which would be downloaded as JSON and
                then converted to a dict before using them here).
            project (str): The name of the Google Cloud project where the
                BigQuery table is located.
            dataset (str): The name of the dataset in the BigQuery table.
            table_name (str): The name of the table in the BigQuery
                dataset.
            col_map (dict): A dictionary mapping the info types to the
                associated column names in the database.
                {'email': email_col,
                 'username': username_col,
                 'password': password_col,
                 'datetime': datetime_col}
                Note that we have datetime too since we need to record
                when the info was updated.
        :param email_function:  Provide the method for email here, this
            can be a callable function or a string. The function can also
            return an error message as a string, which will be handled by
            the error handler.

            The current pre-defined function types are:

            "gmail": the user wants to use their Gmail account to send
                the email and must have the gmail API enabled. Note that
                this only works for local / desktop apps. If using this
                method, you must supply the
                oauth2_credentials_secrets_dict variable and
                optionally the oauth2_credentials_token_file_name
                variable, as parts of the gmail_creds input.
                https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides
            "sendgrid": the user wants to use the SendGrid API to send
                the email. Note that you must have signed up for a
                SendGrid account and have an API key. If using this
                method, you must supply the API key as the sendgrid_creds
                input here.
        :param email_inputs: The inputs for the email sending process.
            These are generic for any email method and currently include:

            website_name (str): The name of the website where the
                registration is happening.
            website_email (str) : The email that is sending the
                registration confirmation.
        :param email_creds: The credentials to use for the email API. Only
            necessary if email_function is not None.

            If email_function = 'gmail':
                oauth2_credentials_secrets_dict (dict): The dictionary of
                    the client secrets. Note that putting the secrets file
                    in the same directory as the script is not secure.
                oauth2_credentials_token_file_name (str): Optional. The
                    name of the file to store the token, so it is not
                    necessary to reauthenticate every time. If left out,
                    it will default to 'token.json'.
            If email_function = 'sendgrid':
                sendgrid_api_key (str): The API key for the SendGrid API.
                    Note that it should be stored separately in a secure
                    location, such as a Google Cloud Datastore or
                    encrypted in your project's pyproject.toml file.

                    Example code to get the credentials in Google Cloud
                        DataStore (you must install google-cloud-datastore
                        in your environment):
                        from google.cloud import datastore
                        # you can also specify the project and/or database
                        # in Client() below
                        # you might also need credentials to connect to
                        # the client if not run on Google App Engine (or
                        # another service that recognizes the credentials
                        # automatically)
                        client = datastore.Client()
                        # replace "apikeys" with the kind you set up in
                        # datastore
                        docs = list(client.query(kind="apikeys").fetch())
                        # replace "sendgridapikey" with the name of the
                        # key you set up in datastore
                        api_key = docs[0]["sendgridapikey"]
            Otherwise, these must be defined by the user in the callable
            function and will likely include credentials to the email
            service.
        :param store_new_info: If you want to store the user's new info
            in a session_state, you can specify that here. Since storing a
            password in session_state can cause potential for dangerous
            leakage, we make the allowable values a string, so the
            developer must specify what to save. You can enter either:
            'any' or a string/list including 'email', 'username' or
            'password' to determine which will be stored when a user makes
            an update. For example, if you wanted to save just email and
            username you could do store_new_info=['email', 'username'].
            These will be stored in the following session_states:
            - email: st.session_state.stuser['new_email']
            - username: st.session_state.stuser['new_username']
            - password: st.session_state.stuser['new_password']
            Note that password will be the hashed password (not the
            original user input).
