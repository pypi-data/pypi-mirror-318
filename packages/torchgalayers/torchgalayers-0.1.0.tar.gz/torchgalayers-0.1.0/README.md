Python package for Geometric / Clifford Algebra in PyTorch, adapted from [Tensorflow GA](https://github.com/RobinKa/tfga).

This project allows to build basic some layers in Geometric / Clifford Algebra in **any Algebra**. 

You are more than welcome to expand and contribute with new type of layers.
