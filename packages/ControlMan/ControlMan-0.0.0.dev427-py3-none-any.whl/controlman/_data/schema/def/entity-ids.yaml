  title: Entity ID
  description: |
    An entity can either be defined as a string or a mapping.
    If it is a string, it is the member or contributor ID of the entity.
    To avoid possible conflicts, you can also use the `member` key to
    explicitly specify whether the ID belongs to a team member or a contributor.
  examples:
    - some_member_id
    - some_contributor_id
    - {id: some_member_id}
    - {id: some_member_id, member: true}
    - {id: some_contributor_id, member: false}

      description: |
        Member or contributor defined by their ID.
        
        As long as there is no conflict between member IDs and contributor IDs,
        it is safe to use this format, omitting the person's membership status.

        Member or contributor defined by their ID and membership status.
        
        By specifying both the ID and membership satus of a person,
        possible ID conflicts can be avoided.
