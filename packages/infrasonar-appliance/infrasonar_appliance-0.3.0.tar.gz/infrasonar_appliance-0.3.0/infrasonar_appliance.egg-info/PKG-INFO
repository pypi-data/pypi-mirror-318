# InfraSonar Appliance Manager

This tool simplifies the installation and management of InfraSonar appliances. It streamlines the process of setting up and running your InfraSonar infrastructure, making it easier to monitor and manage your IT environment.

## Prerequisites

Before using the InfraSonar Appliance Manager, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python _(inclusing pip)_
- Curl

You can install these prerequisites on Ubuntu or Debian-based systems using the following commands:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python curl pip
```

Additionally, Docker Compose is required for the InfraSonar appliance to function properly. You can install Docker Compose using the following command:
```
sudo curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | bash
```

## Installation

To install the InfraSonar Appliance Manager, use the following command:
```
pip install infrasonar-appliance
```

## Usage

Once installed, simply start the tool using the following command:
```
appliance
```

The tool will handle the installation and management of your [InfraSonar appliance](https://docs.infrasonar.com/collectors/probes/appliance/), allowing you to focus on monitoring and managing your IT infrastructure.

## Additional Notes

- For more detailed instructions and troubleshooting guidance, refer to the official [InfraSonar documentation](https://docs.infrasonar.com).
- If you encounter any issues during installation or usage, feel free to [contact](https://infrasonar.com/contact) the InfraSonar support team for assistance.

## API forwarding

To enable InfraSonar agents to communicate with the API when direct access is blocked by firewalls, this tool can establish a forwarding service. This service acts as an intermediary, relaying agent requests to the API.

If you encounter issues binding to port 443 due to insufficient Docker privileges, you can adjust the system settings using the following command:

```
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=0
```

To keep this setting after reboot, create or edit `/etc/sysctl.d/local.conf` and add the following line:

```
net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=0
```
