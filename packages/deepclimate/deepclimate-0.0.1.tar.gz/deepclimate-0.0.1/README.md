- Custom loss functions for climate modeling and other climate-specific metrics.  
- Tools for data preprocessing, visualization, and evaluation metrics.  
- Seamless integration with popular deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow/PyTorch).  

### **Objectives:**
1. Develop a deep learning framework for training deep learning models with climate data.
2. Easy-to-use interface for novice users.
3. Create custom modules for physics-informed training of deep learning models.
4. Custom training loss functions and evaluation metrics related to the climate science community.
5. An open library to add architectures from the literature.

### **Applications:**
- Climate prediction models.
- Hydro-meteorological research.
- Policy-making in climate resilience.
