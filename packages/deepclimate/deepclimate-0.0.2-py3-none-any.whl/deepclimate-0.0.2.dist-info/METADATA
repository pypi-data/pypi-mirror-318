# **DeepClimate**

*A Python package for climate modelling and data analysis with deep learning.*

**Latest Version:** 0.0.2  
**Release date:** January 2, 2025


## **Description** 

**DeepClimate** is an intuitive Python library designed to simplify the training and evaluation of neural networks tailored for climate science. Whether you're working on emulation, downscaling, or bias correction of climate datasets, DeepClimate offers tools and pre-built deep learning models to accelerate your research and applications.

## **Features**  
- Built-in support for state-of-the-art deep learning architectures and training strategies (e.g., CNN, U-Net, GAN, etc.).  
- Custom loss functions for climate modeling and other climate-specific metrics.  
- Tools for data preprocessing, visualization, and evaluation.    

### **Objectives:**
1. Easy-to-use interface for novice users.
2. Develop a deep learning framework for training deep learning models with climate data.
3. Create custom modules for physics-informed training of deep learning models.
4. Custom training loss functions and evaluation metrics related to the climate science community.
5. An open library to host deep learning architectures from the literature.

### **Applications:**
- Climate data downscaling and bias-correction
- Weather/Climate prediction models.
- Hydro-meteorological research.
- Climate data analysis

### **Future Directions**
- Current support for [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). Support for [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is coming soon.
- Addition of Preprocessing Module for NetCDF and GRIB datasets.
- Integration with popular benchmark datasets (e.g., [WeatherBench](https://github.com/pangeo-data/WeatherBench), [ClimateSet](https://climateset.github.io/) etc.)
