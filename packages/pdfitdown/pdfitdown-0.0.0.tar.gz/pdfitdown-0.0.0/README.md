**PdfItDown** is a python package that relies on [`markitdown` by Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/) and [`markdown_pdf`](https://github.com/vb64/markdown-pdf). 

### Applicability

**PdfItDown** is applicable to the following file formats:

- PDF
- PowerPoint
- Word
- Excel
- HTML
- Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML)
- ZIP files (iterates over contents)

### How does it work?

**PdfItDown** works in a very simple way:

```mermaid
graph LR
2(Input File) -->  3[markitdown]
3[markitdown] -->  4[Markdown content]
4[Markdown content] --> 5[markdown-pdf]
5[markdown-pdf] --> 6(PDF file)
```

### Installation and Usage

To install **PdfItDown**, just run:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pdfitdown
```

And then you can simply use it inside your python scripts:

```python
from pdfitdown.pdfconversion import convert_to_pdf

output_pdf = convert_to_pdf(file_path = "BusinessGrowth.xlsx", output_path = "business_growth.pdf", title = "Business Growth")
```

In this example, you will find the output PDF under `business_growth.pdf`.
