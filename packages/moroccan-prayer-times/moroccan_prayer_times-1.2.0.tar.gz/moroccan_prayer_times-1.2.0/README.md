A command-line interface (CLI) application to fetch and display Moroccan prayer times for the current day or the next
prayer time remaining, using data provided by the official [Moroccan Ministry of Habous and Islamic Affairs
website](https://habous.gov.ma/).

## Features

- Display today's prayer times for a selected Moroccan city
- Show the time remaining until the next prayer
- Configure the preferred city and language
- Caching the fetched prayer times for better performance
- Localization support for Arabic, English, and French languages

## Installation

You can install the package using either `pipx` or `pip`.

> **Note**: It is highly recommended to install this package using [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/). It provides
> an isolated environment for installing and managing command-line tools. It also simplifies running CLIs without
> activating a virtual environment.  
> [Check out this page](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/comparisons/) to compare **pip** and **pipx**.

### Using pipx

```shell
pipx install moroccan-prayer-times
```

### Using pip

```shell
pip install moroccan-prayer-times
```

## Usage

After the installation, you can run the CLI application with the following command:

```shell
prayertime help
```

This will display the list of available commands and their descriptions.

### Commands

- `prayertime next`: Show the remaining time until the next prayer.
- `prayertime today`: Display today's prayer times for the configured city.
- `prayertime config`: Display the current configuration (city and language).
- `prayertime setup`: Configure the preferred city and language.
- `prayertime help`: Show the help message.

> Note: the default command is `next`.

## Configuration

The first time you run the application, it will prompt you to select a city (**english** is the default language). These
settings will be saved for future use.

You can change the _**city**_ or the **_language_** anytime using the `setup` command.

> **NOTE:** If you choose to use the Arabic language option with this package, make sure to check the following:
>
> 1. **Terminal Encoding**: Ensure that your terminal is configured to use UTF-8 or another encoding that supports
     Arabic characters. In some terminals or IDEs (like PyCharm), you may need to set the encoding explicitly.
>
> 2. **Font Support**: Verify that your system has fonts installed that support the display of Arabic characters.
     Without proper font support, Arabic text may not render correctly.
