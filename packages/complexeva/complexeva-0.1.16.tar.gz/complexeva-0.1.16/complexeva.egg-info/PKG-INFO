# overview
computing fractal dimensions (and other complexity measures) and complexity measures in networks and matrices. The package includes:

# some functions (thus far)
- Box-counting fractal dimension calculation for networks and matrices
- Higuchi fractal dimension implementation
- Network-to-matrix and image-to-matrix conversions
- Dummy fractal generators for testing
