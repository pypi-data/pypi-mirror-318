The `diego-utils` package is a Python library with some utility functions that I find useful for data science and econometrics.
It is also a place for me to try and formalise some code built across different projects taht I think might be useful in the future.

## üìã Prerequisites

This package is requires a Python version between 3.11 and 3.13.
It uses `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, and `pyproject.toml` for dependency management and packaging.

## üõ´ Set Up

### Install with PyPI

The faster and easier way to install `diego-utils` in using PyPI. From your terminal just run:

```bash
pip install diego-utils
```

### Install through Cloning the repository

Alternatively, `diego-utils` can also be installed by first cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/diego-lda/diego-utils.git
```

Then navigating into the home directory and running:

```bash
pip install .
```

## üóÇÔ∏è How the Project is Organised

The package has several modules, which split the functionality into themes:

- **metrics**: These are econometrics functions, to help with the analysis of data.
- **evaluate**: These are evaluation functions, designed to monitor a pipelines performance.
- **handle**: These are data handling functions, useful in data manipulation and transformation.
