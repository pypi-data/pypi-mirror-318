The `diego-utils` package is a Python library with some utility functions that I find useful for data science and econometrics.
It is also a place for me to try and formalise some code built across different projects taht I think might be useful in the future.

It is built with Python 3.11 and higher, and uses `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, and `pyproject.toml` for dependency management and packaging.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher

## üõ´ Set Up

`diego-utils` can be installed by first cloning the repository, navigating into the home directory and then running:

```bash
pip install .
```

This will install into your computer the `diego-utils` package.

## üóÇÔ∏è How the Project is Organised

The package has several modules, which split the functionality into themes:

- **metrics**: These are econometrics functions, to help with the analysis of data.
- **evaluate**: These are evaluation functions, designed to monitor a pipelines performance.
- **handle**: These are data handling functions, useful in data manipulation and transformation.

## üìñ Documentation and Further Information

The documentation is automatically generated using **GitHub Actions** and **MkDocs**.
