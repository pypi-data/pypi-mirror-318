Compute the delivery method price based on its related delivery product
price according to the sales order pricelist.

It allows to have different pricing per customer, prices depending on
dates, ... The pricelist based cost is computed from the delivery
method's product and the sales order's pricelist.

It supports the following use cases:

- When no "external" provider (e.g. DHL, UPS, ...) is used, a new
  provider "Based on Product Pricelist" is available.
- When an external provider is used, a new option in the "Invoice
  Policy" selection, named "Pricelist Cost", overrides the provider's
  cost by the pricelist based cost.
