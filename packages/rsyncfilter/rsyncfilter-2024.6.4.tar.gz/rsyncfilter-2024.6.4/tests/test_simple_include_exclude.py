SIMPLE INCLUDE/EXCLUDE EXAMPLE
    With the following file tree created on the sending side:

        mkdir x/
        touch x/file.txt
        mkdir x/y/
        touch x/y/file.txt
        touch x/y/zzz.txt
        mkdir x/z/
        touch x/z/file.txt

    Then  the  following  rsync  command  will transfer the file
    "x/y/file.txt" and the directories needed to hold it, resulting in the
    path "/tmp/x/y/file.txt" existing on the remote host:

        rsync -ai -f'+ x/' -f'+ x/y/' -f'+ x/y/file.txt' -f'- *' x host:/tmp/

"""
The following command does not need an include of the "x" directory because it
is not a part of the transfer (note the traililng slash). Running this command
would copy just "/tmp/x/file.txt" because the "y" and "z" dirs get excluded:

    rsync -ai -f'+ file.txt' -f'- *' x/ host:/tmp/x/

This command would omit the zzz.txt file while copying "x" and everything else
it contains:

    rsync -ai -f'- zzz.txt' x host:/tmp/
