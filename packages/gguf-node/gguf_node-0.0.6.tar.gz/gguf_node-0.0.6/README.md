#### idiot option (opt 1 not necessary to go through this since everything inside)
opt `3` to clone the gguf-connector deployment copy (in case you encounter any problem for installing gguf-connector, probably you don't have c/c++ complier or comply it failed, etc. and don't wanna troubleshoot it anymore; or just lazy, then put this copy to your working version python `../site-packages` directory or `./python_embeded/Lib/site-packages` if you are using the portable pack)
