## Features

- **Email-based authentication**: Easily sign up and sign in users using their email and password.
- **Username-based authentication**: Allow users to sign up and sign in using a username and password.
- **Simple integration**: Quickly integrate authentication features into any Python application with minimal code.
- **Seamless API interaction**: The package handles all the HTTP request/response management, making authentication tasks straightforward.

## Api Token

Get Your Api-Token from the [Official Website](https://protobase.pythonanywhere.com/)

## Installation

To install the package, simply use `pip`:

```bash
pip install protobase-client
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s how you can use the **ProtoBase Client** in your Python application:

### 1. Import the package

```python
from protobase_client import ProtoBaseClient
```

### 2. Create an instance of the client

```python
client = ProtoBaseClient()
```

### 3. Sign up with email

To sign up a user with their email and password:

```python
signup_response = client.signup_email("username", "password", "email@example.com", "api_token")
print(signup_response)
```

### 4. Sign in with email

To sign in a user with their email and password:

```python
signin_response = client.signin_email("username", "password", "email@example.com", "api_token")
print(signin_response)
```

### 5. Sign up with username

To sign up a user with just a username and password:

```python
signup_response = client.signup_username("username", "password", "api_token")
print(signup_response)
```

### 6. Sign in with username

To sign in a user with their username and password:

```python
signin_response = client.signin_username("username", "password", "api_token")
print(signin_response)
```

## Example

```python
from protobase_client import ProtoBaseClient

# Initialize client
client = ProtoBaseClient()

# Sign up using email
response = client.signup_email("john_doe", "securepassword123", "john.doe@example.com", "api_token")
print(response)

# Sign in using email
signin_response = client.signin_email("john_doe", "securepassword123", "john.doe@example.com", "api_token")
print(signin_response)
```
