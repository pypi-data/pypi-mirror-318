Formatter for pyproject.toml files.

This package enforces consistent formatting of pyproject.toml files, reducing merge request conflicts and saving time otherwise spent on manual formatting. It also contributes to a cleaner git history and more readable code; enhancing overall project organisation and maintainability. Experience a streamlined workflow, reduced errors, and improved code readability with `pyprojectsort`.

## Features

- Alphanumerically sorts pyproject.toml by:
  - section
  - section key
  - list value
- Reformats pyproject.toml to a standardised style
  - line per list value
  - double quotations
  - trailing commas
  - indentation
  - end of file newline

## Installation

`pyprojectsort` is available via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyprojectsort/):

```console
pip install pyprojectsort
```

### Using pyprojectsort with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com)

To use as an automated git hook, add this to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/kieran-ryan/pyprojectsort
  rev: v0.3.0
  hooks:
    - id: pyprojectsort
```

## Examples

With the following `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.ruff]
ignore = ["G004",
"T201",
    "ANN"
]

[project]
name = 'pyprojectsort'
authors = [
    { name = "Kieran Ryan" },
    "Author Name <author@email.com>",
    {name="Author Name"}
]

[tool.radon]
show_mi = true
exclude = "tests/*,venv/*"
total_average = true
show_complexity = true

[build-system]
build-backend = "flit.buildapi"
requires = ["flit"]
```

Run the package from within its directory:

```console
pyprojectsort
```

The configuration will be reformatted as follows:

```toml
[build-system]
build-backend = "flit.buildapi"
requires = [
    "flit",
]

[project]
authors = [
    "Author Name <author@email.com>",
    { name = "Author Name" },
    { name = "Kieran Ryan" },
]
name = "pyprojectsort"

[tool.radon]
exclude = "tests/*,venv/*"
show_complexity = true
show_mi = true
total_average = true

[tool.ruff]
ignore = [
    "ANN",
    "G004",
    "T201",
]
```

The pyproject file path can alternatively be specified:

```console
pyprojectsort ../pyproject.toml
```

### Check formatting

The **--check** option can be used to determine whether your file would be reformatted.

```console
pyprojectsort --check
```

If the file needs reformatting, the program exits with an error code. This is useful for [pipeline integration](https://github.com/kieran-ryan/pyprojectsort/blob/d9cf5e1e646e1e5260f7cf0168ecd0a05ce8ed11/.github/workflows/main.yml#L30) as it prevents writing back changes so that a clean repository is maintained for subsequent jobs.

The **--diff** option provides similar functionality but also displays any changes that would be made.

```console
pyprojectsort --diff
```

The diff of an alphabetically reordered array will appear as follows:

```diff
@@ -6,8 +6,8 @@
[project]
authors = [
+ { name = "Author Name" },
  { name = "Kieran Ryan" },
- { name = "Author Name" },
]
```
