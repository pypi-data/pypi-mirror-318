indicative documentation
========================

Indicative is a technical analysis library designed with a unique focus on pipeline-oriented programming. While the Python ecosystem already offers numerous technical analysis libraries—whether implemented in pure Python or built in other languages (like C) with Python bindings—Indicative takes a different approach. Drawing inspiration from pipeline-oriented programming paradigms, such as those in F#, it offers a fresh perspective that diverges from the conventional Pythonic style.
