Blockchain CLI Project

Overview

This project is a modular blockchain implementation written in Python. It features a command-line interface (CLI) powered by Click, allowing users to interact with the blockchain by creating wallets, performing transactions, and mining blocks.

The project is designed for learning and experimentation, gradually expanding features like UTXOs, Proof-of-Work, and peer-to-peer networking.

Features
	•	Create a blockchain with a Genesis block.
	•	Generate wallets with unique addresses.
	•	Perform transactions between wallets using UTXO validation.
	•	Mine blocks using a basic Proof-of-Work algorithm.
	•	Modular and extensible structure for future enhancements.

Installation
	1.	Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-cli.git
cd blockchain-cli


	2.	Set Up the Virtual Environment

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Run the CLI

python cli.py --help

Phased Development Plan

Phase 1: Core Blockchain and CLI
	•	Implement a basic blockchain with Genesis block creation.
	•	Add CLI commands for mining blocks, displaying the chain, and validating integrity.
	•	Log all activities for transparency and debugging.
	•	Deliverable: A CLI interface to mine and validate blocks, with basic Proof-of-Work (PoW).

Phase 2: Wallet and Transactions
	•	Introduce wallet creation using public/private key pairs.
	•	Enable transaction creation signed with private keys.
	•	Implement UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model for transaction validation.
	•	Deliverable: Wallets can send/receive transactions validated against the blockchain.

Phase 3: Enhanced Proof-of-Work
	•	Implement dynamic difficulty adjustment for PoW.
	•	Add block rewards for miners to incentivize block creation.
	•	Incorporate a transaction pool for pending transactions to be mined.
	•	Deliverable: Mining rewards and dynamic PoW adjustment to mimic real-world blockchain behavior.

Phase 4: Persistent Storage
	•	Save the blockchain to a database or flat file for persistence.
	•	Load the blockchain state on startup.
	•	Deliverable: Blockchain state survives restarts and can scale with additional blocks and transactions.

Phase 5: Networking and Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
	•	Introduce a WebSocket server to communicate with other nodes.
	•	Enable blockchain synchronization across peers.
	•	Implement consensus rules for handling conflicting chains (e.g., longest-chain rule).
	•	Deliverable: A decentralized blockchain network where nodes can communicate and reach consensus.

Phase 6: Security Enhancements
	•	Use elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) for wallet and transaction signing.
	•	Add encryption for transactions during network communication.
	•	Implement protection against common attacks (e.g., 51% attack simulations, DDoS).
	•	Deliverable: A secure and robust blockchain resistant to tampering and attacks.

Phase 7: Scalability and Optimization
	•	Implement Merkle trees for efficient transaction validation.
	•	Optimize block and chain data structures for scalability.
	•	Explore sharding or sidechains for improved performance.
	•	Deliverable: A scalable blockchain ready for high transaction throughput.

Phase 8: Advanced Features
	•	Smart contract support with a basic scripting language.
	•	Add a governance mechanism for decision-making in the network.
	•	Experiment with alternative consensus mechanisms (e.g., Proof-of-Stake, Delegated PoS).
	•	Deliverable: A full-featured blockchain supporting advanced use cases.

Usage

CLI Commands
	1.	Mine a New Block

python cli.py mine-block "Transaction data"


	2.	Show the Blockchain

python cli.py show-chain


	3.	Validate the Blockchain

python cli.py validate



Expected Workflow
	1.	Create wallets for users.
	2.	Perform transactions between wallets.
	3.	Mine blocks to validate and add transactions to the blockchain.
	4.	Synchronize the blockchain across nodes in the network.
