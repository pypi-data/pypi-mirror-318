## ‚ùóÔ∏è PLEASE NOTE

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Recently the Pystyle library has suffered an update that contains non-legitimate code and that can put at risk your computer and your data, that's why I have been noticed, as a good action towards the community, to upload my own module renamed as "Pybeaut" to continue giving the service that Pystyle used to give with no malicious contexts.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This module uses colour representations in RGB format to perform colour operations such as Diagonal or other functions.
> Some terminals may not support this functionality, especially in non-Windows 10 or 11 environments.
> Please make sure that your terminal supports RGB colours to avoid display problems.
