### **üë©‚Äçüíª Quick Start**

#### **1. Initialize a New Project**

Start your journey with Preswald by initializing a new project:

```bash
preswald init my_project
cd my_project
```

This will create a folder called `my_project` with all the basics you need:

- `hello.py`: Your first Preswald app.
- `config.toml`: Customize your app‚Äôs settings and style.
- `secrets.toml`: Keep your API keys and sensitive information safe.
- `.gitignore`: Preconfigured to keep `secrets.toml` out of your Git repository.

---

#### **2. Write Your First App**

Time to make something magical! Open up `hello.py` and write:

```python
from preswald import text, connect, view

# Render Markdown content
text("# Welcome to Preswald")

# Connect to a CSV file
data_conn = connect("example.csv", "my_data")

# Display the data as a table
view(data_conn)
```

#### **3. Run Your App**

Now the fun part‚Äîsee it in action! Run your app locally with:

```bash
preswald run hello.py
```

This command launches a development server, and Preswald will let you know where your app is hosted. Typically, it‚Äôs here:

```
üåê App running at: http://localhost:8501
```

Open your browser, and voil√†‚Äîyour first Preswald app is live!

### **üí° Examples**

#### **Example 1: Hello World**

```python
from preswald import text

text("# Hello, World!")
```

#### **Example 2: Data Viewer**

```python
from preswald import connect, view

data_conn = connect("example.csv", "example_data")
view(data_conn)
```

#### **Example 3: Interactive Dashboard**

```python
from preswald import text, slider, view, connect

text("# Interactive Dashboard")

slider_value = slider("Rows to Display", min_val=10, max_val=100, step=10, default=50)
data_conn = connect("example.csv", "data")
view(data_conn, limit=slider_value)
```

---

### **üîß Configuration**

Preswald uses `config.toml` for project settings and theming. It‚Äôs straightforward, and it makes your app look polished.

#### **Sample `config.toml`:**

```toml
[theme.color]
primary = "#3498db"
secondary = "#e74c3c"
background = "#f5f5f5"
text = "#333333"

[theme.font]
family = "Roboto, sans-serif"
size = "14px"

[theme.layout]
sidebar_width = "280px"
```
