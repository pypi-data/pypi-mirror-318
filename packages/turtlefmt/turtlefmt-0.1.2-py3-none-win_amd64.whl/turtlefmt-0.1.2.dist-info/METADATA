# TurtleFmt

`turtlefmt` is an auto formatter for [RDF Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) under Apache 2 license.


## Installation

It is currently distributed on:
- [Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/turtlefmt): `cargo install turtlefmt`
- [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/turtlefmt): `pipx install turtlefmt`

Build from source requires NodeJS 6.0+ to be available in your `PATH`.


## Usage

To use it:

```sh
turtlefmt MY_TURTLE_FILE.ttl
```

It is also possible to check if formatting of a given file is valid according to the formatter using:

```sh
turtlefmt --check MY_TURTLE_FILE.ttl
```

If the formatting is not valid, a patch to properly format the file is written to the standard output.

It is also possible to check a complete directory (and its subdirectories):

```sh
turtlefmt MY_DIR
```

## Format

`turtlefmt` is in development and its output format is not stable yet.

Example:
```turtle
@prefix ex: <http://example.com/> . # Prefix
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

# Some facts

<s> a ex:Foo ;
    <p> "foo"@en , ( +01 +1.0 1.0e0 ) . # Foo

# An anonymous blank node
[ ex:p ex:o , ex:o2 ; ex:p2 ex:o3 ] ex:p3 true . # Bar
```

For now, it:
* Validates that the file is valid.
* Maintains consistent indentation and line jumps.
* Normalises string and IRI escapes to reduce their number as much as possible.
* Enforces the use of `"` instead of `'` in literals.
* Uses literals short notation for booleans, integers, decimals and doubles when it keeps the lexical representation unchanged.
* Uses `a` for `rdf:type` where possible.
