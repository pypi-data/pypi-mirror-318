# Grep Exercises

This TUI application includes 50+ questions meant to be solved using `GNU grep` (or alternate implementations like `ripgrep`). Some exercises will require you to combine `grep` with other standard commands such as `cat`, `wc` and `find`.

> **Note:** This application is intended to be run in a Linux-like environment. You might still be able to solve the exercises on other platforms, but I do not know if that'll work.
