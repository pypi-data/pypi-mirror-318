# Osmanthus

Osmanthus is a sophisticated chess engine that employs advanced algorithms to provide a challenging
and enjoyable playing experience. It offers a range of features, including self play, puzzle
solving, and an intuitive command-line interface.

## Installation

Osmanthus can be easily installed using pip:

```sh
pip install osmanthus
```

## Usage

To start the CLI interface, enter the following command:

```sh
osmanthus-cli
```

Moves can be input in Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN) or Universal Chess Interface notation. We
recommend using SAN. If you are new to this notation, we have provided a short guide on our [wiki
page](https://github.com/i13e/osmanthus/wiki/san).

If you are new to playing chess, we suggest checking out [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCSbzArwB10) to learn the fundamentals.
