## Installation
It is recommended to install Pirel as a globally available CLI tool via `uv` (or `pipx`, etc.).
This way you Pirel will show you the status of your active Python interpreter.

```
uv tool install pirel
```

OR

```
pipx install pirel
```

You can also install Pirel into a specific virtual environment.

```
pip install pirel
```

Not that in this case Pirel will only have access to the Python interpreter of this
very virtual environment.


## CLI Docs

<!-- Typer Docs START -->

**Usage**:

```console
$ pirel [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
```

**Options**:

* `--no-cache`: Clear cache before running
* `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose logging; can be supplied multiple times to increase verbosity.  [default: 0]
* `--version`: Dispay the version of pirel
* `--install-completion`: Install completion for the current shell.
* `--show-completion`: Show completion for the current shell, to copy it or customize the installation.

* `guess`: Prompts the user with a random question regarding Python releases.
* `list`: Lists all Python releases in a table.

### `pirel check`

Shows release information about your active Python interpreter.

If the active version is end-of-life, the program exits with code 1.
If no active Python interpreter is found, the program exits with code 2.

**Usage**:

```console
$ pirel check [OPTIONS]
```

**Options**:

* `--help`: Show this message and exit.

### `pirel guess`

Prompts the user with a random question regarding Python releases.

For example, "When was Python 3.9 released?" or "Who was the release manager for
Python 3.6?".

The history is stored in the user data directory.

**Usage**:

```console
$ pirel guess [OPTIONS]
```

**Options**:

* `--help`: Show this message and exit.

### `pirel list`

Lists all Python releases in a table. Your active Python interpreter is highlighted.

**Usage**:

```console

```

**Options**:

* `--help`: Show this message and exit.

<!-- Typer Docs END -->

> [!NOTE]
> You can still invoke `pirel` without a subcommand and you will get a table of all Python releases.
> But note that this is **deprecated**, i.e. please use `pirel list`.

## Development
### Generate Video Demo
To generate the video demo on the top, I used [vhs](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs).

If you change something in the "tape" file `./assets/cli_demo.tape` run the following
command to update the GIF: `vhs assets/cli_demo.tape`
