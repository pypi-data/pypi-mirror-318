# dorm

**dorm** is a lightweight wrapper around Django  that provides a minimal 
interface to its ORM. This package allows you to quickly integrate Django's 
powerful ORM into your project with minimal configurationâ€”simply add a `settings.py`
file to the project root and you're ready to start using it.

> The project is still under active development, use it at your own risk.
> 
> Tested only against:
> - Python: 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
> - Django: 5.0

Familiarity with Django (especially [Models and databases](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/db/)) is expected to use this project.

## Basic Usage

1. Install dorm

```shell
pip install dorm-project
```

2. Initialize your project to use dorm, by adding `settings.py` to the project root

```shell
cd <proj-root>
touch settings.py # << at least add INSTALLED_APPS, DATABASES and DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD
```

```python
# <proj-root>/settings.py

from pathlib import Path

BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).parent.resolve()

INSTALLED_APPS = []

DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
        "NAME": BASE_DIR / "db.sqlite3",
    }
}

DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
```

> TODO: implement `dorm init` command that scaffolds `settings.py` file

3. Call `dorm.setup()` at the entry point of your project, this will ensure that django setup is done properly before usage.
This should be called before any import to Django models.

```python
import dorm

if __name__ == "__main__":
    dorm.setup()
    ...
```

4. Add `models.py` to a new or existing package (this package will be considered as a Django app, check point 5 below), and add some models in it

```shell
mkdir -p <my-package>
touch <my-package>/models.py
``` 

```python
# <my-package>/models.py

from django.db import models


class Post(models.Model):
    title: str = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    slug: str = models.SlugField(unique=True)
    body: str = models.TextField()
```

5. Add the package with `models.py` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`

```python
# settings.py
...
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...,
    "<my-package>",
    ...,
]
...
```

6. Make migrations and migrate with `dorm` commands (can run all django management commands with it - like `shell`, `test`, `dbshell`, etc)

```shell
dorm makemigrations
dorm migrate
```

7. Create some objects with `dorm shell`

```shell
$ dorm shell
...
>>> from blog.models import Blog
>>> blog = Blog(title="Hello", body="... World!!", slug="hello-world")
>>> blog.save()
>>> Blog.objects.all()
```
