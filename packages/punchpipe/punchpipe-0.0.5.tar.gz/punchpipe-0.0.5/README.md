# punchpipe

`punchpipe` is the data processing pipeline for [the PUNCH mission](https://punch.space.swri.edu/).
All the science code and actual calibration functionality lives in `punchbowl`. This package
only automates the control segment for the Science Operations Center.

> [!CAUTION]
> This package is still being developed. There will be breaking code changes until v1.
> We advise you to wait until then to use it.

The `punchpipe` is organized into segments, i.e. levels of processing to produce specific
data products. Segments are referred in code by their ending level,
e.g. `level1` means the Level 0 to Level 1 segment.
