Here we have defined `header`, `footer` and `backimage` - [see also the customization doc](http://rise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customize.html).

See [this other notebook](overlay.ipynb) for a short description of how to use `overlay` instead.

This is a variant of the header-footer notebook, with `scroll` enabled

# Slide 1

- some regular slide
- the content fits the page

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

# Slide 2

- see `header-footer-scroll.css` to see how to tweak the available space
- now for a slide that has a large (high) content
- we create a slide
- with a rather extensive height
- so as to see
- if we can use `"scroll": true` in our settings
- and check that the footer
- does not overlap the contents
- that should scroll within the available space
- between header and footer
- and again
- we create a slide
- with a rather extensive height
- so as to see
- if we can use `"scroll": true` in our settings
- and check that the footer
- does not overlap the contents
- that should scroll within the available space
- between header and footer

# Slide 3

- this slide is to show that:
- if a cell is just long/high enough,
- so that it barely fills out
- the whole page,
- the scroll bar will not be enabled,
- if only the #notebook-container margin is **activated**
- and the rise-scroll margin is **deactivated**
