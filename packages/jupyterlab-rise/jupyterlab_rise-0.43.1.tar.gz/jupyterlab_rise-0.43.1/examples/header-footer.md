Here we have defined `header`, `footer` and `backimage` - [see also the customization doc](http://rise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customize.html).

See [this other notebook](overlay.ipynb) for a short description of how to use `overlay` instead.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

# Slide 1

in this example we have not overridden `scroll` so it means `scroll=False`

regular slides (not too much content) will show up just nice

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

# Slide 2

- now for a slide that has a large (high) content
- because `scroll=False` we don't get to scroll vertically
- we create a slide
- with a rather extensive height
- so as to see
- if we can use `"scroll": true` in our settings
- and check that the footer
- does not overlap the contents
- that should scroll within the available space
- between header and footer
- and again
- we create a slide
- with a rather extensive height
- so as to see
- if we can use `"scroll": true` in our settings
- and check that the footer
- does not overlap the contents
- that should scroll within the available space
- between header and footer
- and a 3rd time
- we create a slide
- with a rather extensive height
- so as to see
- if we can use `"scroll": true` in our settings
- and check that the footer
- does not overlap the contents
- that should scroll within the available space
- between header and footer
