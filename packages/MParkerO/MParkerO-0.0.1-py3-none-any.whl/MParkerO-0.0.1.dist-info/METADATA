# MParkerO
`MParkerO` is a Python-Based Implementation of the Extended Parker-Oldenburg Algorithm for Inverting Multilayer 
           Density Interfacesfrom Gravity Anomalies

A Multilayer Density Interface Inversion toolkit (MParkerO) is introduced to compute the
3-D geometries of multilayer density interfaces from gridded gravity anomalies. We extend
Parker-Oldenburgâ€™s iterative method to handle multilayer density interface scenarios and
implement it within this M-ParkerO toolkit. The method utilizes the relationship between
gravity anomalies and multilayer density interfaces in the frequency domain. Given gravity
anomalies, density contrasts,reference depth and the non-target density interfaces, the target
density interface can be calculated.
