    Physical unit-aware version of `jax.hessian <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.hessian.html>`_,
    computing Hessian of ``fun`` as a dense array.

    Args:
      fun: Function whose Hessian is to be computed.  Its arguments at positions
        specified by ``argnums`` should be arrays, scalars, or standard Python
        containers thereof. It should return arrays, scalars, or standard Python
        containers thereof.
      argnums: Optional, integer or sequence of integers. Specifies which
        positional argument(s) to differentiate with respect to (default ``0``).
      has_aux: Optional, bool. Indicates whether ``fun`` returns a pair where the
        first element is considered the output of the mathematical function to be
        differentiated and the second element is auxiliary data. Default False.
      holomorphic: Optional, bool. Indicates whether ``fun`` is promised to be
        holomorphic. Default False.

    Returns:
      A function with the same arguments as ``fun``, that evaluates the Hessian of
      ``fun``.
