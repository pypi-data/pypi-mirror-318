"""
This module provides functionality for creating and managing an MQTT client.

It includes necessary methods for connecting to an MQTT broker, subscribing to topics,
publishing messages, and handling incoming messages.

The implementation is done in Python 3.13.1 and relies on the `paho-mqtt` library for
the MQTT protocol handling.

Dependencies:
- docutils
- pip
- pylint
- pytest
- requests
- wheel

Make sure to configure the MQTT broker settings appropriately before using the module.

    The MQTTClient class provides a wrapper around the Paho MQTT library to manage MQTT
    connections, subscriptions, and messaging callbacks. It facilitates setting up MQTT
    communication with additional utilities for message handling, subscriptions, decorators,
    and logging. The class is highly configurable, allowing for easy integration into various
    applications requiring MQTT messaging.

    This class configures connection management, initializes callbacks, and supports advanced
    features such as JSON payload processing, fallback mechanisms, and wildcard topic handling.

        The `subscribe` method facilitates MQTT topic subscription by allowing the user to create
        a decorator that processes incoming messages before invoking the decorated function.
        It provides the option to automatically convert JSON payloads to Python dictionaries.
        It also registers the callback to the specified topic and subscribes to it with the
        desired Quality of Service (QoS) level.

        Standard MQTT wildcards are supported:
           - "#" matches any topics under the current level, including multilevel matches.
           - "+" matches exactly one level.
           - If there is a need to capture the value of single level wildcard matched
             by + a parameter can be created. This is achieved by using - instead of
             single + as MQTT standard - syntax like +<parameter_name>+
             The CallbackResolver will then create a parameter <parameter_name> that is
             assigned with value found in the matched topic.
