# HarlanBOT

HarlanBOT is a Python module designed for creating AI-based chatbots. This module utilizes various natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning technologies to enable the bot to learn from conversations and provide relevant responses based on user input.

## Features

- **Train the ChatBot**: Train the chatbot using data from a JSON file containing intents and responses.
- **Real-time Interaction**: The chatbot can respond in real-time based on user input.
- **Easy Customization**: Easily add, modify, or remove intents and responses in the JSON file.
- **Integration with TensorFlow and TFLearn**: Uses TensorFlow and TFLearn to train the chatbotâ€™s deep learning model.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to install and set up HarlanBOT:

### Installation Steps

1. **Install the package**:

    ```bash
    pip install harlanbot
    ```

    This requires the modified `tflearn` package for compatibility with the AI:

    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/harlansr/tflearn.git@master
    ```

2. **Create a Python script**:

    ```python
    from harlanbot import ChatBot
    bot = ChatBot()
    ```

    Run this code for the first time to create the `files/intents.json` file. You can also customize the file name as needed by passing a custom path.

    ```python
    from harlanbot import ChatBot
    bot = ChatBot(files="custom_file_name")
    ```

    This example will create a file named `custom_file_name/intents.json`.

3. **Edit the `intents.json` file**:

    `intents.json` is the file required to train the bot. To tailor the chatbot to your needs, edit the contents of the `intents.json` file.

## Usage

### Example `intents.json` File

```json
{
    "intents": {
        "main": [
            {
                "tag": "greeting",
                "patterns": [
                    "hello",
                    "who are you"
                ],
                "responses": [
                    "Hello, I'm your assistant",
                    "Hi, I'm your assistant"
                ]
            },
            {
                "tag": "goodbye",
                "patterns": [
                    "bye",
                    "I need to go"
                ],
                "responses": [
                    "Okay, have a nice day",
                    "See you again"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### **Explanation:**

| Name      | Description                                                |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| tag       | An identifier that should be unique across all intents.     |
| patterns  | Sample input texts; the more patterns, the better the model. |
| responses | Output responses when matching input patterns. Can be filled with multiple responses, which will be displayed randomly. |

### Training the ChatBot

After customizing the `intents.json` file, when you run:

```python
bot.train()
```

This will train the AI according to the data in `intents.json`. Alternatively, you can train the model everytime code running when you modify the code:

```python
from harlanbot import ChatBot
bot = ChatBot(train=True)
```
