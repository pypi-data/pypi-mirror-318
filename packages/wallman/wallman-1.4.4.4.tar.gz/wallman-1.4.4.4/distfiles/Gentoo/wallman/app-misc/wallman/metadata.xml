    Wallman is a small python program meant to bring dynamic wallpapers 
    to standalone X11 Window managers and Wayland compositors.
    It uses APScheduler in the background. For setting wallpaperss
    It currently relies on feh in the background. libnotify is used for
    Desktop notifications.
