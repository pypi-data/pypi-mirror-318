Introduction to npm, npx, NodeJS and React
==========================================

This page introduces npm, webpack, jest and NodeJS to a Lino developer who wants
to help improving the :term:`React front end`. Lino's :term:`React front end` is
made using these tools.

The tools
=========

- `React <https://react.dev/>`__ is a "library for web and native user
  interfaces".

- `Node.js <https://nodejs.org>`__ is a cross-platform JavaScript runtime
  environment that lets developers create servers, web apps, command line tools
  and scripts.

- `npm <https://www.npmjs.com/about>`__ is a software package manager originally
  developed for JavaScript packages to be run with `Node.js`, but also used for
  other programming languages. It is an interface to the `npm repository`. It
  allows JavaScript developers to share packages quickly and easily. It is also
  a build tool. `npx
  <https://www.naukri.com/code360/library/npx-node-js-package-runner>`__ is the
  Node package runner.

- `webpack <https://webpack.js.org>`__ is a static module bundler for modern
  JavaScript applications.

- `electron <https://www.electronforge.io>`__ is "an all-in-one tool for
  packaging and distributing Electron applications. It combines many
  single-purpose packages to create a full build pipeline that works out of the
  box, complete with code signing, installers, and artifact publishing."

- `Babel <https://babeljs.io/>`__ is a JavaScript compiler.

- `TypeScript <https://www.typescriptlang.org/>`__  is a strongly typed
  programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at
  any scale.

- `Jest <https://jestjs.io>`__ is a JavaScript testing framework.

Creating your own packages
==========================

npm packages must contain at least a file named :xfile:`package.json`, which
must exist in their top-level directory. This file can be generated by :cmd:`npm
init` and later edited manually. But there is a tool that creates a whole
package with a working react app, including a :xfile:`package.json`::

  $ npx create-react-app myapp

It is an npm package, but it isn't
==================================

The :ref:`react` repository is an npm package because it has a
:xfile:`package.json` file, but we don't publish it on the npm repository.
That's not needed because everything needed to run a :term:`Lino site` with the
:term:`React front end` is made available as Django static files inside the
Python package (published on PyPI as `lino-react
<https://pypi.org/project/lino-react/>`__). The whole source code is published
on GitLab.  You need `npm` and `node` only for *developing*  Lino's :term:`React
front end`, not for *using* it.


React framework
===============

TODO: Does Lino use a React framework? Seems that not.

Lino React files reference
==========================


.. xfile:: package.json

  Any project that uses `Node.js` needs to have a :xfile:`package.json` file.

  The :xfile:`package.json` of an npm project lists the packages it depends on,
  contains information about its unique source control and specific metadata
  like the project's name, description, and author.

  The npm package description for lino_react.

  The :xfile:`package.json` for `lino_react` mainly defines a few "scripts"
  (i.e. commands)::

    "scripts": {
      "debug": "webpack --mode none ",
      "dev": "webpack --mode development",
      "build": "webpack --mode production",
      "build_css": "node_modules/node-sass-chokidar/bin/node-sass-chokidar ./lino_react/react/components/layout -o ./lino_react/react/components/layout",
    },

  The commands ``debug``, ``dev`` and ``build`` create the :xfile:`main.js`
  file. They  are very similar, their only difference is the `--mode
  <https://webpack.js.org/configuration/mode/>`__ option, which tells webpack to
  use its built-in optimizations accordingly.

  `webpack <https://webpack.js.org/>`__ is a tool that bundles all the "assets"
  into a set of deployable files (.js, .css etc).
  We use it to compile the :xfile:`index.js` file into the :xfile:`main.js` file.

  Our ``build_css`` script compiles scss files to css files. We need to run it
  only after changing one of our scss files which are located in
  :file:`lino_react/react/components/layout`.

  ``build_css`` runs `node-sass-chokidar
  <https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass-chokidar>`__, which is a "thin
  wrapper around node-sass executable to use chokidar instead of Gaze when
  watching files." `Node-sass <https://github.com/sass/node-sass>`__ is "a
  library that provides binding for Node.js to LibSass, the C version of the
  popular stylesheet preprocessor, Sass. It allows you to natively compile .scss
  files to css at incredible speed and automatically via a connect middleware."


.. xfile:: webpack.config.js

  Our configuration file for webpack.  TODO: what does it do?

.. xfile:: lino_react/react/index.js

  The entry point for webpack.
  Contains a single line of code::

    import App from "./components/App";

.. xfile:: react/main.js

  A generated file is in :xfile:`lino_react/react/static`

  It contains a lot of generated and compressed JS code.

  It is quite big and therefore causes webpack to issue a warning::

    WARNING in asset size limit: The following asset(s) exceed the recommended size limit (244 KiB).
    This can impact web performance.
    Assets:
      main.js (1.24 MiB)

Troubleshoot issues with Node.js and npm
===========================================

How to see which version you have::

  $ npm -v
  10.8.2
  $ node -v
  v20.17.0

Some issues might be caused by version conflicts caused by earlier installation
attempts on your machine. Here is how to restart from scratch::

  $ go react
  $ rm -rf node_modules
  $ rm package-lock.json
  $ npm install


Not sure when this is useful::

  $ npm cache clean --force

Seems that it's important to do the following setting::

  npm config set legacy-peer-deps true

(I had issues with dependencies, found `this discussion on SO
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64573177/unable-to-resolve-dependency-tree-error-when-installing-npm-packages>`__
and after setting it my issues were gone)

Site data
=========

.. glossary::

  site data

    The :attr:`state` attribute of the :class:`App` object (defined in :xfile:`App.jsx`) has a key
    ``site_data``.

JS code can say e.g. ``if(this.state.site_data.use_push_api) ....``
