# ELIANA Library

ELIANA (Event Log and Incident Analysis) is a software log analysis library developed at the Paranal Observatory. It is designed to facilitate the analysis and understanding of logs generated by the software operating instruments and telescopes. The library provides a variety of functionalities, including a dataset generator class based on Pandas, a public logs dataset, a log tokenizer, and a statistical anomaly detection module.

## Features

Dataset: A set of dataset generator classes built on top of Pandas to help create and manage event log datasets and its metadata. It includes access to parlogs-observations, a publicly available dataset consisting of event logs from instruments and telescopes.

Log Tokenizer: A utility for tokenizing log messages, enabling efficient parsing and analysis of log content.

Statistical Anomaly Detection: A module designed to identify anomalies in log data through statistical analysis, useful for detecting irregularities or incidents.
