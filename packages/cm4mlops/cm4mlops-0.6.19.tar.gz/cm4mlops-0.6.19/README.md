# MLPerf Automations and Scripts

This repository contains the automations and scripts used to run MLPerf benchmarks, primarily focusing on MLPerf inference benchmarks. The automations used here are largely based on and extended from the [Collective Mind script automations](https://github.com/mlcommons/cm4mlops/tree/main/automation/script).


## Collective Mind (CM) Automations

**CM (Collective Mind)** is a Python package with a CLI and API designed to create and manage automations. Two key automations developed using CM are **Script** and **Cache**, which streamline ML workflows, including managing Docker runs.
