  # Maintain dependencies for GitHub Actions as recommended in SPEC8:
  # https://github.com/scientific-python/specs/pull/325
  # At the time of writing, release critical workflows such as
  # pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish should use hash-based versioning for security
  # reasons. This strategy may be generalized to all other github actions
  # in the future.
