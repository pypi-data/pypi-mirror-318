              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.

              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Pond Agent

A Python package for building AI agents to solve [Pond's AI model competitions](https://cryptopond.xyz/modelFactory/list). This package is mainly for educational purposes and intended to show you how AI agents work under the hood. Hence, it is designed to be lightweight and doesn't use those popular agent frameworks. Moreover, it is also intended to be a good starting point for those who are not sure how to start with the competition. Lastly, you are more than welcome to build on top of this package to crack the competitions or build your own agent.

Currently, the package only includes the competition agent. More agents might be added in the future and you are invited to build them together!

**Note**: As LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) are not deterministic, the results may vary from run to run. It might even generate wrong code which cannot be executed. A bug fixing agent is included but it is not guaranteed to fix all bugs. If any error occurs, please rerun the notebook/script. If you encounter any issues, please report them as [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Pond-International/pond-agent/issues).

## Features
- End-to-end agent for solving [Pond's AI model competitions](https://cryptopond.xyz/modelFactory/list). Currently, the agent supports supervised learning tasks but not recommendation tasks. 
- Automatic competition data scraping - just provide the competition URL and the agent will download all necessary files
- Minimalistic agent implementation using OpenAI's API directly. This way you can easily understand how the agent works and debug if things go wrong: use LLM to get instructions on how to solve a problem, use LLM to turn the instructions into code, and call tools such as Python to execute the code. However, this simplistic approach means it doesn't support many advanced features, such as memory, general tool usage, and complex workflows. But once you grasp the basics, it is easy to start with the fancier frameworks such as [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai), [crewai](https://www.crewai.com/), [autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen), [PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/), just to name a few.
- Modular architecture for easy extension. The competition agent is actually a collection of agents and tools including data processor, feature engineer, model builder, etc. You can add your own agents, tools, and LLMs.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pond-agent
```

### Browser Setup
The package uses Playwright for web scraping, which requires Chrome browser. After installing the package, run:
```bash
# Install browser
playwright install chromium
```
If you're on Linux, you might need to install additional dependencies.

## Usage

Check out the [Examples](#Examples) below for quick start.

There are two ways to set up the competition data:

### Option 1: Automatic Download (Recommended)
Simply provide the competition URL when creating the agent:

```python
from pond_agent import CompetitionAgent

# Initialize agent with competition URL
agent = CompetitionAgent(
    working_dir="path/to/working/directory",
    competition_url="https://cryptopond.xyz/modelFactory/detail/2",
    llm_provider="openai",
    model_name="gpt-4o"
)

# Run the pipeline
agent.run()
```

The agent will automatically download:
- Competition overview (`overview.md`)
- Data dictionary (`data_dictionary.xlsx`)
- Dataset files in the `dataset/` directory

### Option 2: Manual Setup
You can also manually set up the required files in your working directory:
1. `overview.md`: Description of the competition in markdown format. Copy from the Overview tab on the competition webpage.
2. `data_dictionary.xlsx`: Dataset description Excel file. Download from the Dataset tab.
3. `dataset/`: Directory containing data in parquet format. Download and unzip from the Dataset tab.

Then initialize the agent without a competition URL:
```python
agent = CompetitionAgent(
    working_dir="path/to/working/directory",
    llm_provider="openai",
    model_name="gpt-4o"
)
```

**Note**: If all required files already exist in your working directory, the agent will skip downloading even if `competition_url` is provided.

### OpenAI API Setup
Create a `.env` file in your project directory with your OpenAI API key:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### Output Structure
When you run the agent, it will:
1. Create an `output/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/` directory containing:
   - `processed_data/`: Clean and preprocessed datasets
   - `feature_data/`: Data with engineered features
   - `models/`: Trained models
   - `scripts/`: Generated Python scripts for each step
   - `report.md`: Detailed report from each step
   - `submission.csv`: Final predictions in the required format
2. Create daily rotating logs in the `logs` directory:
   - `YYYYMMDD.log`: Current day's execution logs
   - Archived logs are automatically rotated with timestamp suffixes

The agent will provide detailed logs of its progress in both the terminal and the `logs` directory, documenting each step from data processing to submission generation.

## Examples

Check out the [examples](examples/) directory for:
- Complete end-to-end competition solutions
- Sample project structure and configuration
- Examples of execution logs and outputs

Available examples:
1. [Sybil Address Detection](examples/sybil_address/): End-to-end pipeline for the [sybil addresses detection competition](https://cryptopond.xyz/modelFactory/detail/2).

## Development

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and create a new branch:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cryptopond/pond-agent.git
cd pond-agent
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Create a virtual environment (choose one):
```bash
# Using venv
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# OR
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Using conda
conda create -n pond-agent python=3.11
conda activate pond-agent
```

3. Install package in development mode:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

4. Install browser for web scraping:
```bash
# Install browser
playwright install chromium
```
If you're on Linux, you might need to install additional dependencies.

### Testing

The project uses `pytest` for testing. Tests are located in the `tests/` directory.

To run tests:
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage report
pytest --cov=pond_agent

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_agent.py
```

To add new tests:
1. Create test files in the `tests/` directory with the prefix `test_`
2. Use pytest fixtures for common setup
3. Follow the existing test structure for consistency
4. Ensure tests are atomic and independent

Example test:
```python
def test_MyAgent_initialization():
    agent = MyAgent()
    assert agent is not None
```

### Publishing to PyPI

1. Update version number in `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[project]
name = "pond-agent"
version = "x.y.z"  # Update this version
```

2. Install build and publish tools:
```bash
pip install --upgrade build twine
```

3. Build the package:
```bash
# Clean previous builds
rm -rf dist/
rm -rf build/

# Build new distribution
python -m build
```

4. Test the package on TestPyPI (recommended):
```bash
# Upload to TestPyPI
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# Test installation from TestPyPI
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pond-agent
```

5. Publish to PyPI:
```bash
# Upload to PyPI
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

You'll need to provide your PyPI credentials when uploading. You can store them in `~/.pypirc` to avoid typing them each time:
```ini
[pypi]
username = __token__
password = your-pypi-token

[testpypi]
username = __token__
password = your-testpypi-token
```

Make sure to:
- Update the version number following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
- Test the package on TestPyPI before publishing to PyPI
- Keep your PyPI tokens secure and never commit them to version control
