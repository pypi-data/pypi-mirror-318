# Deepseek Coder

This package uses Deepseek Coder 1.3B Instruct-tuned Language Model for code generation in the terminal.

A GPU is not required but makes the responses faster.

It's based on:
- [Aider](https://aider.chat/)
- [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/)


### Backlog
- [] improve Aider default prompts and prevent multiple completions due to "improperly formatted response"
