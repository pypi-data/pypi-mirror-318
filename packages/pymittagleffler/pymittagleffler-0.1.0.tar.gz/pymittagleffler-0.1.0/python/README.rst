mittagleffler
-------------

This library implements the two-parameter Mittag-Leffler function.

Currently only the algorithm described in the paper by `Roberto Garrapa (2015)
<https://doi.org/10.1137/140971191>`__ is implemented. This seems to be the
most accurate and computationally efficient method to date for evaluating the
Mittag-Leffler function.

* `Documentation <https://mittagleffler.readthedocs.io>`__.
* `Code <https://github.com/alexfikl/mittagleffler>`__.

Rust Crate
----------

The library is available as a Rust crate that implements the main algorithms.
Evaluating the Mittag Leffler function can be performed directly by

.. code:: rust

    use mittagleffler::MittagLeffler;

    let alpha = 0.75;
    let beta = 1.25;
    let z = Complex64::new(1.0, 2.0);
    println!("E_{}_{}({}) = {}", alpha, beta, z, z.mittag_leffler(alpha, beta));

    let z: f64 = 3.1415;
    println!("E_{}_{}({}) = {}", alpha, beta, z, z.mittag_leffler(alpha, beta));

This method will call the best underlying algorithm and take care of any special
cases that are known in the literature, e.g. for $`(\alpha, \beta) = (1, 1)`$ we
know that the Mittag-Leffler function is equivalent to the standard exponential.
To call a specific algorithm, we can do

.. code:: rust

    use mittagleffler::GarrappaMittagLeffler

    let eps = 1.0e-8;
    let ml = GarrappaMittagLeffler::new(eps);

    let z = Complex64::new(1.0, 2.0);
    println!("E_{}_{}({}) = {}", alpha, beta, z, ml.evaluate(z, alpha, beta));

The algorithm from ``Garrappa2015`` has several parameters that can be tweaked
for better performance or accuracy. They can be found in the documentation of the
structure, but should not be changed unless there is good reason!

Installation
============

The crate can be built from the root directory using

.. code:: bash

    cargo build --all-features --release

To run the tests, you can do

.. code:: bash

   cargo test --tests

Python Bindings
---------------

The library also has Python bindings (using `pyo3 <https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3>`__)
that can be found in the ``python`` directory. The bindings are written to work
with scalars and with ``numpy`` arrays equally. For example

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    from pymittagleffler import mittag_leffler

    alpha, beta = 2.0, 2.0
    z = np.linspace(0.0, 1.0, 128)
    result = mittag_leffler(z, alpha, beta)

Installation
============

The bindings use the `maturin <https://github.com/PyO3/maturin>`__ build system
to package the library. To create wheels for your system, directly run

.. code:: bash

    python -m build --wheel .

To run the tests, you can do

.. code:: bash

   python -m pytest -v -s test
