# Solvis API Evaluations

A Python package to request and process API evaluations into structured pandas dataframes.
This tool is designed to handle complex nested data structures typically returned by APIs, efficiently transforming them into a tabular format suitable for analysis.

## Features

- Converts nested evaluation data into a flat Pandas DataFrame.
- Handles various question types, including:
  - **NPS (Net Promoter Score)**
  - **Scale**
  - **Multiple Choice**
  - **Text and Short Text**
  - **Multiple Response**
  - **Special Types** (Phone, CPF, CNPJ, Email)
- Robust handling of unexpected or malformed data.
- Logging for process tracking and debugging.

## Installation

Install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install solvis-api-evaluations
```

## Usage

### Importing the Module

```python
from data_processing import DataProcessing
```

### Example

```python
# Sample input data
evaluations = [
    [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "survey_id": 123,
            "formatted_answers": [
                {
                    "answer_type": "Scale",
                    "answers": [
                        {
                            "question_text": "How satisfied are you?",
                            "choice_text": "Very Satisfied",
                            "choice_value": "5.0"
                        }

                }
            ]
        }
    ]
]

# Initialize the processor
processor = DataProcessing()

# Process the data
df = processor.data_processing(evaluations)

# Display the DataFrame
print(df)
```
