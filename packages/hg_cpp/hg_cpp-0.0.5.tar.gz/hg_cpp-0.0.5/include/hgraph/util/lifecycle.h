     *   in order to deal with reverse dependencies, etc.
     *
     * * The component will have initialise called, in a graph context this call is in topological sort order.
     *
     * * The start method is called prior to normal operation of the code, this can perform actions such as schedule node
     *   evaluation, and should also delegate the call to any components managed by this component.
     *
     * * The stop method is called once normal operation of the code is expected to cease. This can be used to stop threads
     *   or perform any state clean-up required.
     *
     * * The dispose method is called once the component is no longer required and in a graph context will be called in
     *   reverse topological sort order.
     *
     * NOTE: The start and stop life-cycle methods can be called numerous times during the life-time of the component.
     *       The code should ensure that it is able to start again cleanly after stop has be called. Stop is not dispose,
     *       full clean-up is called only on dispose.
     *
     * Since any life-cycle controlled component is likely to reasonably heavy weight, it seems reasonable to make them
     * ref-counting as well. *** May change my mind about this, but for now seems reasonable ***
