Add a task that discovers bad pixels. Both IR and VIS cameras have static bad pixel maps provided by the DL team, and
the IR cameras take an additional step of computing dynamic bad pixels from a combination of lamp gain data and the
standard deviation over a stack of dark arrays. Pixels in the computed bad pixel map have their values set to NaN in two
places: during binning when computing demodulation matrices, and during Science Calibration. Thus, bad pixels are NaN in
L1 science data.
