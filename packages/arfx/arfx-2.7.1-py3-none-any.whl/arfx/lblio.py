"""Read and write lbl format files.

lbl is a format developed by the Margoliash lab. It's not a very good or
flexible format, but it's what the venerable data inspection and labeling
program aplot uses, so it's important to be able to read it.

This code is adapted from https://github.com/kylerbrown/lbl

The lbl standard uses the following format:

    7 lines of garbage (the header)

After the header, each line represents an entry with space separated elements.

    The first element is a floating point time stamp
    the second element is garbage (the number 121)
    the third element is the label or name.
