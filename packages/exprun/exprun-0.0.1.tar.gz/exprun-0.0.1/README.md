# ExpRun

`exprun` allows building simple [python](https://python.org) pipelines for reproducible numerical experiments.

## Quick start

With `exprun`, an experiment is run using an instance of the `Runner` class, based on a [yaml](https://yaml.org) configuration file, with a specified results directory, save directory and number of repeats.

```python
from exprun import Experiment, Runner

class MyExperiment(Experiment):
    # Define the experiment here (see below)
    ...

config_path = './config.yml'
result_dir = './results/'
save_dir = './saves/'

runner = Runner()
runner.run(MyExperiment, config_path, result_dir, repeats=10)
runner.plot(MyExperiment, config_path, result_dir, save_dir)
```

The above code runs 10 times `MyExperiment`, each result is saved at `result_dir` as a [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) file.
The results found in this directory that match the current configuration are recovered, plotted, and saved at `save_dir` as a [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) file.

In the `MyExperiment` class, four functions need to be specified by the user:

- `setup(self) -> None`: Set up the experiment from the information in the configuration file.
- `run(self) -> dict`: Perform one run of the experiment and return the results as a dict.
- `cleanup(self) -> None`: Clean up the experimental data.
- `plot(self, results: list) -> dict`: Process the results obtained from a list of all the results found in the results directory that match the configuration file. Returns the plot data that must be saved.

For instance, a simple experiment that computes the sum of two numbers within a range specified in the configuration file could be defined as follows.
First, let's write the `config.yml` file.

```yaml
min: 1
max: 10
```

Next, let's fill the `MyExperiment` class functions.

```python
class MyExperiment(Experiment):

    def setup(self) -> None:
        from random import randrange
        # You can access the config data from self.config
        self.a = randrange(self.config["min"], self.config["max"])
        self.b = randrange(self.config["min"], self.config["max"])
    
    def run(self) -> dict:
        # You can access the data of the setup function
        return {"sum": self.a + self.b}

    def cleanup(self) -> None:
        # Nothing to clean up here
        pass

    def plot(self, results: list) -> dict:
        # Print the mean of the sums among all the results
        # found matching the current configuration file
        sums = [result["sum"] for result in results]
        print("Mean of sums:", sum(sums) / len(sums))
        return {"sums": sums}
```

And as simple as that, you have a reproducible experiment that can be run multiple times with different configurations.
