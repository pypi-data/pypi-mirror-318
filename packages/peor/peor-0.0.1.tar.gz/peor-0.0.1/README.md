# PEOR
PortableExecutable shellcodifier. <br />
This project is made to create an embedded shellcode out of PE files. <br />

*NOTE* that `PEOR` isn't made to easily shellcodify Windows-executables, <br />
As we won't resolve imports for you. For such utility, use [pe2shellcode](https://github.com/hasherezade/pe_to_shellcode).

## What can PERO do?
`PEOR` is the worst PE shellcodifier! <br />
We do not resolve imports, nor optimize your PE-sections. <br />
This project is intended to shellcodify PE files for embedded usage, <br />
Thus not using allocations / resolving correct page protections for sections. <br />
You can use `PEOR` to shellcodify windows applications, but `PEOR` won't resolve imports for you. <br />
You can use it to shellcodify uefi applications, but we won't locate the EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE nor provide a image_handle to the entrypoint. <br />
You can use `PEOR` to write a simple piece of code, that compiles into a PE-file, and make a shellcode out of it. <br />

Advantages over normal pe-shellcodifiers:
- you can write your embedded-code once and write it anywhere (windows usermode/kernel, linux, uefi, embedded-flash devices, ...)
-

Disadvanteges over normal pe-shellcodifiers:
- we only support embedded-code, thus custom utils like `implicit imports` and `exceptions` are not supported by the shellcodifier and should be implemented by the user, within the shellcode scope
- we can't trust the existence of allocation functions (like `VirtualAlloc` or `ExAllocatePoolWithTag`), thus the whole PE-file is resolved, highly increasing the shellcode size
- we can't assume that PAGE-PROTECTION concept even exists, thus `PEOR` assumes that the whole shellcode is mapped to `RWX` memory

## How to use PEOR?
Simply provide a PE-file whose code fits to your target platform (e.g. do not access `CR3` register from usermode context) and has no exceptions / imports. <br />
You may use exceptionless cpp-code using [`etl`](https://github.com/ETLCPP/etl) or rust-code with custom allocator. <br />
Simp;y
