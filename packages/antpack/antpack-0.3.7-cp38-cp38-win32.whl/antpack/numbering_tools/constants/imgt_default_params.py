#These are positions that are essentially mandatory. A sequence that deviates
#from one of these is an alignment issue or has a very large deletion. Note that
#IMGT defines position 89 as highly conserved in the sense that a hydrophobic
#amino acid is always observed here, but "hydrophobic amino acid" is not defined
#and a variety of (hydrophobic) aas are observed at that position. Hence we
