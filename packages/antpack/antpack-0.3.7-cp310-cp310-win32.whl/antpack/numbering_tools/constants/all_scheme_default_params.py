"""Contains default params shared by all schemes. Currently this comprises
only gap penalties for the N-terminal. This region is tricky because there
are frequenly large N-terminal deletions -- and also sometimes 
deletions located 10 AAs or so in from the N-terminal. We use
'staircase' gap penalties to encourage the aligner to handle this
sensibly. In any case where positions present in this gap penalty list
are also present in a scheme-specific constants file, the scheme-specific
file takes precedence."""
