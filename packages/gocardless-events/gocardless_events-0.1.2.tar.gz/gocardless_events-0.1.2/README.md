# gocardless event schemas

> This is an unofficial library. GoCardless provide the [gocardless-pro python library](https://pypi.org/project/gocardless-pro/).
> The reason this exists is because that library is not typed.

Type-safe Python models for for all GoCardless events (using Pydantic).

This is a Python implementation of the Event Actions in the [GoCardless docs](https://developer.gocardless.com/api-reference#event-actions).

Since I only use Python 3.13+ this library doesn't support older versions, but
PRs are welcome.
