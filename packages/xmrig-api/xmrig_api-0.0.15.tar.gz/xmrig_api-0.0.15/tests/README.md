# Tests

This directory contains tests for the XMRig API.

## Live Miner

Tests in this section interact with a live miner instance. Ensure that a miner is running and accessible before executing these tests.

## Mocked Miner

Tests in this section use mocked data to simulate miner responses. These tests do not require a live miner instance and can be run in isolation.
