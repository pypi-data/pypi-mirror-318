## Quick Start

Initialize the client with your API key:

client = LemonSqueezy(api_key="your_api_key")
```

### Examples

```python
# List all your stores
stores = client.list_stores()

# Get customer information
customers = client.list_customers()

# Manage products
product = client.get_product(123)
all_products = client.list_products()
product_variants = client.get_product_variants(123)

# Handle digital files
file = client.get_file(456)
all_files = client.list_files()

# Work with variants
variant = client.get_variant(789)
all_variants = client.list_variants()
```

Alternative examples:

```python
from lemonsqueezy.api.customer import list_customers
from lemonsqueezy.api.product import list_products

all_customers = list_customers(client)
all_products = list_products(client)
```

## Configuration

You can configure the client using environment variables:

```env
LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY=your_api_key
LEMONSQUEEZY_API_URL=https://api.lemonsqueezy.com/v1  # Optional
```

Then create your client object:

```python
from lemonsqueezy import LemonSqueezy

client = LemonSqueezy()
```

Or pass configuration directly to the client:

```python
client = LemonSqueezy(
    api_key="your_api_key",
    api_url="https://api.lemonsqueezy.com/v1"  # Optional
)
```
