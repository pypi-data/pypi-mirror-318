# Description

Quick-sort is a sorting algorithm which uses recursion and is composed of two
different procedures.

## Procedures of the quick-sort algorithm

1. Partition

    All elements smaller than one element of the input list, the "pivot", are
    put to the left of the pivot.

    In this partition algorithm, the pivot is chosen to be the last element of
    the list. In general, we may choose another pivot, e.g. the middle element.

    We keep searching for elements less than the pivot, from the left to the
    right in the range [start, end[, and we insert them at the position tracked
    by the variable p.

    So, p keeps track of the position (or index) in the range [start, end[,
    where all elements to the left of p are smaller than the pivot.

    Before returning this position, p, the pivot is inserted in that position.
    Note: by doing this, the pivot will be already in its final sorted position.

2. Recursive Calls

    quick_sort is called recursively on the left of the pivot and on the right
    until start >= end.

# TODO

- Add ASCII animation of a sorting example using quick-sort!
- Improve efficiency of best case time complexity and space complexity.
- Implement 3-way partition to improve best case of time complexity of
quick-sort.
