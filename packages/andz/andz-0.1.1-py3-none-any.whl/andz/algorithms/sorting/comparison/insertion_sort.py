# Description

It is a simple sorting algorithm which sorts a list by shifting elements one by
one.

## Properties

- comparison-based sorting algorithm
- stable
- in-place
- efficient for "small" lists
- adaptive (reduces the number of comparison if the list is already sorted)
- Better than bubble-sort for almost-ordered lists, even though both have
a best-case time complexity of O(n).
- Online (can sort a list as it receives it)

# TODO

- Add ASCII animation of a sorting example using insertion-sort!
- Add key parameter to sort by key
