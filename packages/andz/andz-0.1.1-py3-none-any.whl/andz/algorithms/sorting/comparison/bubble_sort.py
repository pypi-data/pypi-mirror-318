# Description

Bubble-sort is an algorithm which is used to sort N elements that are given in a
memory. For example, an array or list with N number of elements. Bubble-sort
compares all the element one by one and sort them based on their values.

It is called bubble-sort, because with each iteration the smaller element in the
list bubbles up towards the first place, just like a water bubble rises up to
the water surface.

Sorting takes place by stepping through all the data items one-by-one in pairs
and comparing adjacent data items and swapping each pair that is out of order.

# TODO

- Add ASCII animation of a sorting example using bubble-sort.
