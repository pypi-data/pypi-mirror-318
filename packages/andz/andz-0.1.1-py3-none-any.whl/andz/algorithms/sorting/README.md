# [Sorting Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm)

Algorithms to sort sequences.

The algorithms under [`comparison`](./comparison) are comparison sorting algorithms, while the algorithms under [`integer`](./integer) are integer sorting algorithms, which can beat the `Î©(n * log(n))` lower bound of comparison sorting algorithms.

## Properties

There are different properties of sorting algorithms that one might be interested in.

- Time complexity
- Space complexity
- Stability
- In-place vs not-in-place
- Comparison sorting vs integer sorting
- Recursive
- Method: insertion, merging, exchange, selection, etc.
