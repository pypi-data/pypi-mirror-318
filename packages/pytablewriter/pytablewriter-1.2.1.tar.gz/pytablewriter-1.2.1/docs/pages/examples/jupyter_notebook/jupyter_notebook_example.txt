All table writer class instances in ``pytablewriter`` can render in Jupyter Notebook.
To render writers at notebook cells, you will require the dependency packages to be installed either by:

- ``pip install pytablewriter[html]`` or
- ``pip install pytablewriter[all]``

Jupyter Notebook code examples can be found `here <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/thombashi/pytablewriter/blob/master/examples/ipynb/jupyter_notebook_example.ipynb>`__:
