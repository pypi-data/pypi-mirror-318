`Sweepystats` is a python package for performing the statistical [sweep operation](https://hua-zhou.github.io/teaching/biostatm280-2017spring/slides/11-sweep/sweep.html) on `numpy` matrices. 

> The sweep operator is perhaps the most versatile tool of all statistical operators that not only afford solutions to the normal equation and a gamut of additional statistics, but also allow complete insight into the nature of least squares. Once mastered, the general concepts of the sweep operator allow the whole least squares process to be visualized. 
> -- James H. Goodnight (1979)

> Although there are faster and numerically more stable algorithms for inverting a matrix or solving a least-squares problem, no algorithm matches the conceptual simplicity and utility of sweeping.
> -- Kenneth Lange (2010)

## Installation

```shell
pip install sweepystats
```

## Documentation

Visit [https://biona001.github.io/sweepystats](https://biona001.github.io/sweepystats)

## Features

The following operations are supported **in-place** and **allocation-free**:

+ Matrix inversions
+ Computation of determinants
+ Checking of (strict) positive-definiteness
+ Linear regression (beta hat, variance of OLS estimator, residuals)
+ ANOVA
+ Stepwise regression

## Running tests

1. Git clone the repo
2. Install `pytest` via `pip3 install pytest` if you haven't already
3. Execute `pytest tests` in the top level directory of `sweepystats`
