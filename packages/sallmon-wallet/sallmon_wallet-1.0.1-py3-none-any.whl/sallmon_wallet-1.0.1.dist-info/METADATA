# Sallmon Wallet CLI

## Overview

The Sallmon Wallet CLI is a cryptocurrency wallet management tool designed for seamless blockchain integration. Developed by MinakiLabs, the project is an open-source initiative governed by principles of transparency, security, and adaptability.

## Custodianship and Philosophy

MinakiLabs reserves the right to act as the custodian of this MIT-licensed project. While the code is available to all for transparency and open-source collaboration, custodianship ensures the integrity and longevity of the project. 

This approach reflects the principle that while anyone is free to use or access parts of the code for their needs, the entirety of the project remains under the stewardship of MinakiLabs and its selected collaborators. 

MinakiLabs' philosophy aligns with the idea that the full scope of the project should be treated with the same care and discretion as the ownership of a cryptocurrency wallet. Transparency is provided on a need-to-know basis to maintain both trust and security.
