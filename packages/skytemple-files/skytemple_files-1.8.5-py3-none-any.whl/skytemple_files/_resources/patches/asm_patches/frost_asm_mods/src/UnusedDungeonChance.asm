; This patch fixes the unused chance in dungeon properties, restoring its original functionality. If the chance passes, one of the rooms in the current
; floor will be turned into a maze made up of walls.

; This file is intended to be used with armips v0.11
; The patch "ExtraSpace.asm" must be applied before this one
; Required ROM: Explorers of Sky (EU/US/JP)
; Required files: overlay_0029.bin, overlay_0036.bin

; Mark rooms where a wall maze has been generated as inelegible for secondary terrain generation. This stops the game from generating both a maze and water/lava lakes,
; which can make some tiles unreachable, potentially softlocking the player if the stairs happen to be there.
