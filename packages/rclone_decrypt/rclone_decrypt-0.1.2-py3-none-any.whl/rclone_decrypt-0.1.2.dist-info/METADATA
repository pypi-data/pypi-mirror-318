# rclone-decrypt
## Status
![test](https://github.com/mitchellthompkins/rclone-decrypt/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)
![build](https://github.com/mitchellthompkins/rclone-decrypt/actions/workflows/build_app.yml/badge.svg)

## Description
`rclone-decrypt` is a utility which will decrypt files that were encrypted with
[rclone](https://rclone.org/). The anticipated use-case is that a user has
independently downloaded an **encrypted** file or directory directly from a
remote cloud storage (Backblaze B2/Amazon Drive/Dropbox/etc...) and now wants to
decrypt it.

Given an rclone.conf file, this tool is simply a wrapper around `rclone` which
sets up a "local remote" to host the downloaded encrypted files and then calls
`rclone copy` in order to decrypt the files into a desired output folder.

Ostensibly I did this because my family backs-up our local NAS to a remote host
but the rest of my family prefers to download files one-off from the cloud host
and are not comfortable using the rclone CLI. This offers a CLI in addition to
an easy-to-use GUI to make life simple.

### Notes
* **Use at your own risk! Be sure you have copies of anything you're trying to
decrypt, just in case something goes wrong!**
* When decrypting files with encrypted filenames or folder names, the directory
  or filename must _only_ consist of the encrypted version. For example, if an
  encrypted file was downloaded as `path_to_encypted_file_4567asd8fasdf67asdf`
  where `4567asd8fasdf67asdf` is the encrypted part, the filename must be
  renamed to exclude the `path_to_encypted_file_` portion. Otherwise rclone will
  complain about invalid encryption names.
* Windows is _not_ currently supported, although it probably would not take very
  much work to get it there. I do not have ready access to a windows environment
  on which to test.
* I'd love to make the GUI look more modern, but most solutions involve a style
  which seems incompatible with
  [tkinterdnd2](https://github.com/Eliav2/tkinterdnd2) which provides the drag
  and drop feature.

## Installation
```
pip3 install rclone-decrypt
```

## Requirements
### General
* `rclone` must be installed and in `$PATH`

### Python environment
* `Python >= 3.7 <3.12`
* `Python-tk` must be installed if using the GUI

### Executable
**UNDER DEVELOPMENT** An OSX `.app` is generated but is currently untested.

## Usage
### CLI usage
```
> rclone-decrypt --config /path/to/rclone.conf --files /path/to/file/or/dir/
```

Example usages:
```
> rclone-decrypt --config rclone.conf --files /home/my_encrypted_dir
> rclone-decrypt --config rclone.conf --files /0f12hh28evsof1kgflv67ldcn/9g6h49o4ht35u7o5e4iv5a1h28
> rclone-decrypt --config rclone.conf --files /home/my_encrypted_file.bin
```
### GUI usage
If the python package is installed directly then the GUI can be invoked from the
command line, as shown below. Otherwise the packaged binary can be downloaded
and executed directly.
* Files can be dropped directly into the big white box.
* As files are dropped, if no output directory has been provided though the file
  dialog, an output directory called 'out' will be created at the same directory
  level as the last dropped file to be decrypted.
* A default location for `rclone.conf` is provided, others can be browsed for.
