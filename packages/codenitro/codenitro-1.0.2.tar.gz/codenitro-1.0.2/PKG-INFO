# 🔥Code Nitro: Code to Image from the Command Line
Ever want to share your code as an image? Code Nitro can do that. Code Nitro is lightweight, has minimal dependencies, and works online and offline.

Don't send your code to third parties, use Code Nitro.

## 🛠️Installation
You can install the `nitro` command with pip.

```bash
pip install codenitro
```

And that's it.

## 🎬 Demo

## ⭐Features
There are three main features. (There are four items because the last one isn't really a feature.)

1. Convert an entire file to an image. Code Nitro will save it in the same directory with the same name (but with .png).

```bash
nitro my_code.py
```

2. Convert only part of a file by using `--lines`. For example, `--lines=5-10` will print lines 5 through 10, inclusive.

```bash
nitro my_code.py --lines=5-10
```

3. Download a file from GitHub and convert it to an image. You don't need to do anything special, just include the url in place of the filename.

```bash
nitro https://github.com/lukesalamone/code_nitro/blob/master/nitro.py
```

4. You can remove the shadow and gradient by passing `--plain`.
