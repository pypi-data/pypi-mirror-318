#### Installation (from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/streamsnapper))

```bash
pip install -U streamsnapper  # It does not have any features by default, but it can be extended with optional features
pip install -U streamsnapper[merger]  # It has the feature of merging video files with audio files using FFmpeg (currently it does not need any dependencies)
pip install -U streamsnapper[youtube]  # It has advanced features to extract data from YouTube, with support for several other features
pip install -U streamsnapper[all]  # It has all features available at once
```

### Example Usage

#### `streamsnapper[merger]`

```python
from streamsnapper import Merger


# A class for merging multiple audio and video streams into a single file.

    # Initialize the Merger class with the required settings for merging audio and video streams.
    logging=False  # Enable or disable FFmpeg logging. (default: False)
)

# Merge the video and audio streams into a single file.
merger.merge(
    video_path='path/to/video',  # The path to the video file to merge. (required)
    audio_path='path/to/audio',  # The path to the audio file to merge. (required)
    output_path='path/to/output',  # The path to save the output file to. (required)
