# {fa}`list` API Reference
iNaturalist currently provides three API versions:

* The original [Rails-based API](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/api+reference) (v0). It is likely
  that this API will be deprecated at some point in the future.
* The [Node-based API](https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/docs/) (v1) allows read and write access
  to most iNaturalist resources, and is generally faster and more consistent than the v0 API.
* The [v2 API](https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/docs/) is currently in development, and will
  eventually replace both the v0 and v1 APIs. see
  [this forum thread](https://forum.inaturalist.org/t/obs-detail-on-api-v2-feedback/21215)
  if you are interested in testing it out.

Pyinaturalist provides functions to use the v0 and v1 APIs, with experimental v2 features coming soon.
Also see {ref}`endpoints` for an overview of which iNaturalist endpoints are currently implemented.
