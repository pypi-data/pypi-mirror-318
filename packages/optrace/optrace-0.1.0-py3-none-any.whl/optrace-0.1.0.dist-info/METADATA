3D raytracer for optical simulations

### IMPORTANT INFO
This is not an "art" program, but a scientific simulator for light paths. First pre-alpha version.
Not user-friendly yet. Uses OpenGL for display of 3D scene. No GPU raytracing-capability yet.
Might get rewritten in C/C++, with access from Python through DLL, or optimized for GPUs in Python.
