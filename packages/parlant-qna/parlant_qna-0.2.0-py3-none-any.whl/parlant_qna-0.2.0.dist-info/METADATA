A dynamic question-answering tool service that helps your Parlant agents provide accurate, traceable responses based on your FAQ data.

### What is this?

This tool service enables your Parlant agents to answer questions based on a managed set of questions and answers that you provide.

### ✨ Key Features ✨

The service carefully evaluates each question against your FAQ, providing:

- 📝 **Detailed explanation** of how the question was interpreted in light of the FAQ
- 📚 **References to specific source material** used (question IDs and relevant quotes)
- 🔍 **Complete traceability** for each response through session events in Parlant sessions (via tool events)
- 🛡️ **Protection against hallucination** - if the information isn't in your knowledge base, the agent won't make up an answer

### 🚀 Getting Started

Install `parlant-qna`:

```bash
$ pip install parlant-qna
```

You can run the service in two ways:

```bash
# As a standalone server
parlant-qna serve

# Or as a hosted module within your Parlant server
parlant-server --module parlant_qna.module
```

### 📚 Adding FAQs

Add question/answer pairs dynamically through the CLI:

```bash
$ parlant-qna add \
    -q "What are your business hours?" \
    -a "We're open Monday through Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM Eastern Time."
```

### ⚡⚙️ How It Works

When your agent needs to answer a question, it calls the `find_answer` tool through the `qna` service. The service then:

1. Evaluates the question for proper context and intent
2. Searches your FAQs for relevant information
3. Constructs an answer using only verified information
4. Records the entire process as a tool event in the session
5. Returns both the answer and detailed metadata about sources used

Example response:

```json
{
  "answer": "We're open Monday through Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM Eastern Time.",
  "evaluation": "Question seeks information about operational hours, which is provided in the background information",
  "references": [
    {
      "question_id": "dja8-108fj",
      "quotes": ["Monday through Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM Eastern Time"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 💡 Use Cases

Perfect for:

- Building customer service agents that need accurate, verifiable answers
- Creating internal support bots that can explain their reasoning
- Developing agents that need to provide source references for their responses
- Ensuring compliance by preventing agents from making up information
