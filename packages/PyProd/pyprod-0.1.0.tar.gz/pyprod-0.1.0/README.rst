PyProd - More Makeable than Make
=================================

PyProd is a Python script that can be used as an alternative to Makefile. By leveraging Python's versatility, it enables you to define build rules and dependencies programmatically, allowing for dynamic configurations, integration with existing Python libraries, and custom build logic not easily achievable with traditional Makefiles. For detailed documentation, please refer to the `official documentation <https://example.com/pyprod-docs>`_.


Features
--------

- Define build rules in Python: Use Python functions to create clear and concise build logic.
- Specify dependencies for each rule: Automatically track and resolve dependencies between files, such as source files and headers.
- Easily extendable with custom Python functions: Integrate custom logic for specialized tasks, like code linting or deployment.
- Manages virtual environments: Automatically create and manage virtual environments for each project, ensuring a clean and isolated build environment.

Installation
--------------

To install PyProd, simply use pip:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install pyprod

Usage
-----

In PyProd, a traditional Makefile for C can be expressed as a Python script like this:


.. code-block:: python

    CC = "gcc"
    CFLAGS = "-I."
    DEPS = "hello.h"
    OBJS = "hello.o main.o".split()

    @rule("%.o", depends=("%.c", DEPS))
    def compile(target, src, *deps):
        run(CC, "-c -o", target, src, CFLAGS)

    @rule("hello.exe", depends=OBJS)
    def link(target, *objs):
        run(CC, "-o", target, objs)

    def clean():
        run("rm -f", OBJS, "hello.exe")

    all = "hello.exe"

To run the build script, simply execute:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ cd project
    $ pyprod
