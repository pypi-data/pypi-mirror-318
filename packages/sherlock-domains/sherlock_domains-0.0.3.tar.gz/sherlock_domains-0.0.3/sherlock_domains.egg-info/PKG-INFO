# Sherlock Domains Python SDK


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

### Installation

Install latest from the GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/Fewsats/sherlock-python):

``` sh
$ pip install git+https://github.com/Fewsats/sherlock-python.git
```

``` sh
$ pip install sherlock-domains
```

## How to use

Create a Sherlock instance with a private key for the agent to use. If
no key is provided, a new one will be generated and saved to the default
config file.

``` python
s = Sherlock()
s
```

    Sherlock(pubkey=90ba884688884277e49080712f386eebc88806efa8345ca937f75fe80950156d)

You can search for a domain and request to purchase it. Purchasing a
domain requires contact information as mandated by ICANN.

``` python
sr = s.search("trakwiska.com")
sr
```

    {'id': '5ef79dc9-20fa-469c-9fda-938330eb3056',
     'created_at': '2024-12-31T11:40:34.941Z',
     'available': [{'name': 'trakwiska.com',
       'tld': 'com',
       'tags': [],
       'price': 1105,
       'currency': 'USD',
       'available': True}],
     'unavailable': []}

``` python
c = Contact(**{
    "first_name": "Test",
    "last_name": "User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "address": "123 Test St",
    "city": "Test City",
    "state": "CA",
    "country": "US",
    "postal_code": "12345",
})

s = Sherlock(c=c)
pr = s.request_purchase('trakwiska.com', sr['id'])
```

The request purchase will return different payment offers and payment
methods. To buy this domain usign a credit card we do:

``` python
s.process_payment(pr['payment_request_url'], first(pr['offers'])['id'], 'credit_card', pr['payment_context_token'])
```

    {'payment_method': {'checkout_url': 'https://checkout.stripe.com/c/pay/cs_live_a116wkFWokfHw73UFQI65GoWEAt4JTEja6OG3v5GOcb1zZljF9a0BABkm0#fidkdWxOYHwnPyd1blppbHNgWjA0S3VzXDdBbTFNVlJzfDVRQVQ2dVdBTnJTSH1QMGs2dHRsanJMbkY0PTxKbUtRaWowT2NwMGM8RlVBbGRqSWo3UFYwcVdqR3F9N2BtM2ZTPXc1Z3dQXGc2NTVPYVVSQkM8bycpJ2N3amhWYHdzYHcnP3F3cGApJ2lkfGpwcVF8dWAnPyd2bGtiaWBabHFgaCcpJ2BrZGdpYFVpZGZgbWppYWB3dic%2FcXdwYHgl',
      'lightning_invoice': None},
     'expires_at': '2024-12-31T12:10:36.498Z'}

You can now use the checkout URL to complete the purchase and the domain
will be registered to your agent.

You can view your domains with:

``` python
s.domains()
```

    [{'id': 'd9b2cc30-c15d-44b9-9d39-5d33da504484',
      'domain_name': 'h402.org',
      'created_at': '2024-12-28T18:58:49.899Z',
      'expires_at': '2024-12-31T18:58:42Z',
      'auto_renew': False,
      'locked': True,
      'private': True,
      'nameservers': [],
      'status': 'active'}]

Below is a list of all the tools that the client offers to manage the
domains and purchases.

``` python
s.as_tools().map(lambda t: t.__name__)
```

    (#9) ['me','search','request_purchase','process_payment','domains','dns_records','create_dns','update_dns','delete_dns']

## AI agents

We will show how to enable your AI assistant to handle payments using
[Claudette](https://claudette.answer.ai), Answer.ai convenient wrapper
for Claude. You’ll need to export your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

``` python
from claudette import Chat, models
```

``` python
import os
# os.environ['ANTHROPIC_LOG'] = 'debug'
```

``` python
model = models[1]; model
```

    'claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620'

Create a Sherlock instance with a public & private key for the agent to
use.

Sherlock supports returning all the tools with `s.as_tools()`.

In order to request a purchase, we need to provide a contact
information. You can either do so during the class initialization or
manually. Then we just pass the extra tool.

``` python
sp = 'You are a helpful assistant that has access to a domain purchase API.'
chat = Chat(model, sp=sp, tools=s.as_tools())

pr = f"Search if domain 'the-favourite-game.com' is available? If it is request a purchase and process the payment using credit card method."
r = chat.toolloop(pr, trace_func=print)
r
```
