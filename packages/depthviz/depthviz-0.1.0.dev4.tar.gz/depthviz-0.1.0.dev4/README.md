**depthviz** makes it easy to add dynamic depth tracking, giving your viewers a deeper understanding of your underwater sensation. It is a command-line tool for generating depth overlay videos from the data recorded by your dive computer. It processes your dive log and creates a video that visualizes the depth over time.

This allows you to create more informative and engaging dive videos, enriching the storytelling experience for both yourself and your audience. [Click here to watch a sample video.](https://www.instagram.com/p/DAWI3jvy6Or/)

## Installation

**Prerequisites:**

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.9 or higher) installed on your system.
* [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/) for installing Python CLI tools.

**Installation:**

```bash
pipx install depthviz
```

## Usage

**1. Download Your Data:**

* Ensure your dive computer data is exported in a CSV format with two columns:
    * `Time`: Represents the time elapsed since the dive start (e.g., in seconds).
    * `Depth`: Represents the current depth during the dive (e.g., in meters).

**2. Generate the Overlay:**

```bash
depthviz -i <input_file.csv> -s <sample_rate> -o <output_video.mp4>
```

**Arguments:**

* `-i`, `--input <input_file.csv>`: Path to your CSV file containing depth data. 
* `-s`, `--sample-rate <sample_rate>`: Sample rate (in seconds) at which your dive computer recorded the data. (e.g., 0.25, 0.5, 1, etc.)
* `-o`, `--output <output_video.mp4>`: Path or filename for the generated video with the depth overlay.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Sample rate** is crucial for the accuracy of the depth visualization over time. Consult your dive computer manual for this information.

> [!TIP]
> If your dive computer recorded data every 1 second, **set the sample rate to 1**. (i.e., 1 sample per second) If your dive computer recorded data 4 samples per second, **set the sample rate to 0.25**. (i.e., 1 sample every 0.25 seconds)

**Example**:

Here's an example of using `depthviz` to generate a depth overlay video named `depth_tracking.mp4` with a sample rate of 0.5 seconds, using the data from `my_dive.csv`:

```bash
depthviz -i my_dive.csv -s 0.5 -o depth_tracking.mp4
```

**3. Integrate with Your Footage:**

Import the generated overlay video into your preferred video editing software and combine it with your original dive footage. Adjust the blending and position of the overlay to suit your video style.
