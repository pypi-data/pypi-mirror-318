# AI Character Framework

A powerful Python framework for creating interactive AI characters with voice capabilities. Create engaging, personality-driven AI agents that can listen, think, and speak in real-time conversations.

## Features

- 🎙️ **Real-time Voice Interaction** - Seamless audio input processing with noise detection
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Conversations** - Leverages advanced language models for natural dialogue
- 🗣️ **Text-to-Speech** - High-quality voice synthesis with customizable voices
- 👀 **Vision Capabilities** - Optional image understanding and processing
- ⚙️ **Flexible Configuration** - Easy YAML-based character customization
- 🎭 **Personality Engine** - Create unique character personalities through system prompts
- 🔊 **Advanced Audio Processing** - Intelligent silence detection and ambient noise handling
- 📦 **Modular Design** - Easy to extend and customize for different use cases

## Prerequisites

Before installing the AI Character Framework, ensure you have:

- Python 3.10 or higher
- A virtual environment tool (like `venv` or `conda`)
- An API key for your chosen language model (e.g., OpenAI)
- A voice provider API key (e.g., ElevenLabs)
- PyAudio dependencies (for audio processing)
  - On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio`
  - On macOS: `brew install portaudio`
  - On Windows: No additional installation needed

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai_character.git
   cd ai_character
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Unix/macOS:
   source venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your environment variables:
   ```bash
   # On Unix/macOS:
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your-api-key"

   # On Windows:
   set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
   set ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

## Quick Start

1. Create a configuration file `config.yaml` for your character:
   ```yaml
   system_prompt: "You're Skullton, a playful and spooky toy skeleton with a mischievous streak. 
                  Engage with users in a way that's fun, a little eerie, but always friendly."
   voice_id: "your-elevenlabs-voice-id"
   greetings:
     - "Boo! Did I scare you? Just kidding!"
     - "Welcome to my spooky corner!"
   enable_vision: true
   model: "gpt-4-vision-preview"
   ```

2. Run the test script to start interacting with your character:
   ```bash
   python test_local.py
   ```

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration
The framework uses YAML configuration files to define character behavior. Here's what each core setting does:

| Parameter | Description | Default | Required |
|-----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `system_prompt` | Defines the character's personality and behavior | None | Yes |
| `voice_id` | ElevenLabs voice ID for speech synthesis | None | Yes |
| `greetings` | List of possible greeting messages | [] | No |
| `enable_vision` | Enable image processing capabilities | false | No |
| `model` | Language model to use (e.g., gpt-4-vision-preview) | "gpt-4" | No |

### Advanced Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `duration` | Recording duration in seconds | 1 |
| `sampling_rate` | Audio sampling rate | 16000 |
| `num_channels` | Number of audio channels | 1 |
| `silence_threshold` | Threshold for silence detection | 10 |
| `silence_count_threshold` | Required silent frames to stop recording | 10 |
| `ambient_noise_level_threshold_multiplier` | Noise detection sensitivity | 3.0 |
| `max_file_size_bytes` | Maximum audio file size | 26214400 |
| `enable_lonely_sounds` | Enable ambient character sounds | false |
| `enable_squeak` | Enable interaction sounds | false |

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from ai_character import AICharacter

# Initialize with basic configuration
config = {
    'system_prompt': 'You are a helpful assistant.',
    'voice_id': 'your-voice-id',
    'model': 'gpt-4o-mini'
}

character = AICharacter(config)

# Basic conversation loop
try:
    # Get user input
    user_input = character.listen()
    
    # Generate and speak response
    response = character.think_response(user_input)
    character.speak(response)
finally:
    character.cleanup()
```

### Advanced Usage
```python
from ai_character import AICharacter

# Initialize with advanced configuration
config = {
    'system_prompt': 'You are a storytelling assistant.',
    'voice_id': 'your-voice-id',
    'model': 'gpt-4-vision-preview',
    'enable_vision': True,
    'sampling_rate': 44100,
    'silence_threshold': 15,
    'enable_lonely_sounds': True
}

character = AICharacter(config, debug=True)

try:
    # Custom greeting
    character.speak("Let me tell you a story...")
    
    # Process image and voice input
    image_path = "example.jpg"
    user_input = character.listen()
    response = character.think_response(user_input, image=image_path)
    character.speak(response)
finally:
    character.cleanup()
```
