`work` is a stupid simple time tracker.

A typical `work`-day might look like,

```shell
$ work task "First task of the day"

$ work task "Second task of the day" --chore

$ work list
08:29 - 10:20   Chore   Second task of the day  2h 51min
08:19 - 08:29   Work    First task of the day   0h 10min

$ work status
Current task: "Second task of the day"
Type: Chore
Duration: 2h 51min

$ work stop

$ work report
2024-12-01      3h 01min (Total)
                2h 51min (Chore)
                0h 10min (Work)


Week Total:     3h 01min
```

## Usage

To begin a task,

```shell
work task "Starting my first task"
```

Tasks have 1 of 4 possible classifications:

- `Chore`
- `Break`
- `Toil`
- `Work`

The default is `Work` and the others are enabled by their respective flag.
For example, to create a `Break` task,

```shell
work task --break "Going for lunch"
```

The previous task will end when a new task begins.
Similarly, a task can be stopped explicitly with,

```shell
work stop
```

`work status`, `work list`, and `work report` are available to analyze current and previous tasks.

### Shutdown and Notification services

Optionally, install [`systemd` user services](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd/User) which notify you when you're not tracking any tasks and stop any running tasks on system shutdown.

To install and enable the services,

```shell
work install
```

They can be disabled with,

```
work uninstall
```

### Autocomplete

`work` provides autocomplete for `bash`, `fish`, `powershell` and `zsh` shells.
For example, to enable autocomplete for the `bash` shell,

```shell
work completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/work > /dev/null
```

_Note: this does require the [bash-completion](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion/) package is installed._

For more information, see `work completion <shell> --help` for your respective `<shell>`.
