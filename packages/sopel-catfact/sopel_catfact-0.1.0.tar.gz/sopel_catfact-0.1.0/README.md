# sopel-catfact

Fetch a random cat fact right in your IRC!

## Installing

Releases are hosted on PyPI, so after installing Sopel, all you need is `pip`:

```shell
$ pip install sopel-catfact
```

## Using

This plugin provides one command, `.catfact`. It takes no arguments, and does
exactly what it says on the tin:

```
<dgw> .catfact
<Sopel> A cat will tremble or shiver when it is in extreme pain.
```

_This example uses Sopel's default `.` prefix. Your bot's setting might differ._
