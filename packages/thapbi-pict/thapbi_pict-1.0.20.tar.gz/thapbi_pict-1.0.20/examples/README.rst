This folder contains multiple examples for use with THAPBI PICT, each with
their own ``README.rst`` file for context.

The associated documentation is in ``../docs/examples/`` as RST files, and
can be read at https://thapbi-pict.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/

Helper scripts:

* ``setup_all.sh`` to download the raw data and do any setup
* ``run_all.sh`` to generate all the intermediate files and output reports
* ``test_all.sh`` to cross check the documentation for the examples
* ``clean_all.sh`` to remove most intermediate files
