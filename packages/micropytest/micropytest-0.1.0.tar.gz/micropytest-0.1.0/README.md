# microPyTest

A minimal, **“pytest-like”** testing framework designed to help you **test anything using Python**.
It works by:

- Discovering test files that match `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`
- Running each test function in real time (with immediate logs)
- Injecting a **test context** (`ctx`) that provides logging methods and artifact tracking
- **Storing per-test durations** in `.micropytest.json` for future **time estimates**
- Offering **quiet** or **verbose** CLI modes

**Current version**: `micropytest version: X.Y.Z` (logged at startup)

> **Note**: Since micropytest can be used to test **anything** via Python scripts, it’s useful for test tasks like:
> - Calling external APIs and verifying responses
> - Testing local scripts or command-line tools
> - Running hardware or network checks
> - Any scenario where Python can orchestrate or verify results, *not* just Python libraries

## Installation

You can install **micropytest** via pip. For instance, from a local checkout:

```bash
pip install micropytest
```

This will make the `micropytest` command available in your current Python environment.

---

## CLI Usage

From the root of your project (or any directory containing tests):

```bash
micropytest [OPTIONS] [PATH]
```

**Options**:

- **`-v, --verbose`**: Increase logging verbosity (e.g., show debug messages).
- **`-q, --quiet`**: Quiet mode—only a colorized summary at the end.

If you **omit** the path, `micropytest` defaults to the **current directory** (`.`).

**Examples**:

```bash
micropytest
micropytest -v my_tests
micropytest -q /path/to/tests
```

Watch the **live** logs as each test starts, logs messages, and finishes with a summary.

---

## Features & Highlights

1. **Real-time Console Output**
   - A special “live” log handler flushes output **immediately**, so you see logs as they happen (no waiting for buffers).

2. **Test Discovery**
   - Recursively scans for files named `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`, and for each Python function named `test_*`.

3. **Test Context (`ctx`)**
   - If your test function is defined with a parameter, e.g. `def test_something(ctx):`, micropytest will pass in a `TestContext`.
   - The context offers logging shortcuts (`ctx.debug()`, `ctx.warn()`, etc.) and **artifact tracking** (recording files or data for later review).

4. **Per-Test Durations**
   - After each test, micropytest logs its exact runtime and stores it in `.micropytest.json`.
   - Future runs use that stored duration to **estimate** how long each test might take.

5. **Quiet & Verbose Modes**
   - **Quiet mode**: minimal final summary only (handy for CI or quick checks).
   - **Verbose mode**: additional debug output per test, plus all logs in real time.

6. **Colorful Output**
   - Uses [**colorama**](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) (if installed) to color warnings, errors, passes/fails, etc.
   - Falls back to plain text if colorama is unavailable.

## Writing Tests

Below is a quick overview of **how to write your tests** for micropytest, including **logging**, **asserts**, and **artifacts**.

### 1. Creating Test Files

Place your tests in files named `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`, anywhere in your project. For example:

```
my_project/
└── tests/
    ├── test_example.py
    ├── sample_test.py
    └── ...
```

As soon as you run `micropytest`, it will **automatically** discover these test files.

### 2. Defining Test Functions

Inside each test file, define **functions** that begin with `test_`. For instance:

```python
# test_example.py

def test_basic():
    # This test doesn't need a context; we can just use normal Python asserts.
    assert 1 + 1 == 2, "Math is broken!"

def test_with_context(ctx):
    # This test *does* accept a context parameter (ctx).
    # We can log, store artifacts, etc.
    ctx.debug("Starting test_with_context")

    # Normal Python assertion still applies
    assert 2 + 2 == 4

    # Artifacts: store anything you like for later
    ctx.add_artifact("some_info", {"key": "value"})
```

### 3. Using Logging

Micropytest captures any log calls (e.g., `logging.info`, `logging.warning`) **plus** calls on `ctx`:

- **Standard Python logging**:

  ```python
  import logging

  def test_logging():
      logging.info("This is an INFO log from standard logging.")
      logging.warning("And here's a WARNING.")
      assert True
  ```

- **Context-based logging**:

  ```python
  def test_with_ctx(ctx):
      ctx.debug("This is a DEBUG message via the test context.")
      ctx.warn("This is a WARNING via the test context.")
      assert True
  ```

All these logs appear **in real time** on the console, and also get saved in the test’s log records for the final summary if you run in verbose mode.

### 4. Using Asserts

You can simply use **Python’s built-in `assert`** statements:

```python
def test_something():
    assert 5 > 3
    assert "hello" in "hello world"
```

If an assertion fails, micropytest will **catch** the `AssertionError` and mark the test as **FAILED**.

### 5. Using Artifacts

Artifacts let you **record** additional data—like files or JSON objects—that help diagnose or preserve test information:

```python
def test_artifacts(ctx):
    # For example, check if a file exists
    filepath = "my_data.txt"
    ctx.add_artifact("data_file", filepath)

    # If 'my_data.txt' does NOT exist, you'll see a warning in the logs
    # (and you can choose to fail the test if needed)
```

**Artifacts** appear in the final logs (verbose mode) or can be extracted programmatically after the run. They are purely for your convenience—micropytest doesn’t enforce pass/fail on artifact existence unless you want to (you can raise exceptions if a file is missing).

---

## Running Tests Programmatically (No CLI)

Even though micropytest ships with a **CLI**, you can **import** and **run tests** from your own code if you prefer:

```python
# run_tests_example.py
from micropytest.core import run_tests

def custom_test_run():
    # Suppose we want to run tests from "./my_tests",
    # but not via the command line
    results = run_tests(tests_path="./my_tests", show_estimates=True)

    # 'results' is a list of dicts like:
    #  {
    #    "file": filepath,
    #    "test": test_name,
    #    "status": "pass" or "fail",
    #    "logs": list of (log_level, message),
    #    "artifacts": dict of your stored artifacts,
    #    "duration_s": float (runtime in seconds)
    #  }

    # Summarize
    passed = sum(1 for r in results if r["status"] == "pass")
    total = len(results)
    print(f"Programmatic run: {passed}/{total} tests passed!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    custom_test_run()
```

By setting up appropriate **logging handlers** in your code, you can also see real-time logs in your own custom environment.

---

## About `.micropytest.json`

A file named **`.micropytest.json`** (in your project directory) tracks **test durations** between runs:

```json
{
  "_comment": "This file is optional: it stores data about the last run of tests for estimates.",
  "test_durations": {
    "tests\\test_something.py::test_foo": 1.2345,
    "tests\\test_hello.py::test_world": 0.0521
  }
}
```

- Each **key** is `filepath::test_function`, mapping to the **most recent** runtime in seconds.
- On subsequent runs, micropytest uses these durations to guess how long each test might take, printing estimates such as `est ~0.8s`.
- Deleting or ignoring this file simply means you lose time-based estimates (the framework still runs tests normally).

## Example Output

Here’s an example **verbose** run:

```bash
micropytest -v examples
```

You might see:

# Changelog

## v0.1 - 2025-01-01
- Initial release

# Developer Guide

## Local Development

If you plan on **making changes** to micropytest (fixing bugs, adding features, etc.) and want to test those changes **locally** before sharing or publishing, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the source):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BeamNG/micropytest.git
   cd micropytest
   ```

2. **Create and activate** a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   # (Windows) .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Make changes** in the source code:
   - Edit files under `micropytest/` (or wherever the main package code lives).
   - Update docstrings, add tests, etc.

4. **Install locally**:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

5. **Test locally**:
    ```bash
    micropytest examples
    ```


## Building & Publishing

Once you have **tested and verified** your local changes and are ready to publish your own version of micropytest to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) (or to a private index, or just for distribution within your team), follow these steps:

1. **Set up** a fresh environment (optional but recommended for a clean slate):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   # (Windows) .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install** the necessary build tools (and other dependencies if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install build twine colorama
   ```

3. **Build** the distribution:
   ```bash
   python -m build
   ```
   - This command will create a `dist/` folder containing the source distribution (`.tar.gz`) and wheel (`.whl`) files.

4. **Upload** to PyPI (or TestPyPI) using [Twine](https://twine.readthedocs.io/):
   ```bash
   # For PyPI:
   twine upload dist/*

   # For TestPyPI (recommended for a dry run):
   twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
   ```

5. **Install & verify**:
   ```bash
   pip install micropytest
   micropytest --version
   ```
   - Confirm the installed version matches the one you just published.
   - Test it in a clean environment to make sure it works as intended.

That’s it! Now your modified version of micropytest is on PyPI (or TestPyPI), and others can install it via:

```bash
pip install micropytest
```
