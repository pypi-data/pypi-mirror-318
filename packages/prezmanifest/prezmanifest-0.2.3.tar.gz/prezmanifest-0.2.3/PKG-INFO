# Prez Manifest

A Prez Manifest is an RDF file that describes and links to a set of resources that can be loaded into an RDF database for the [Prez graph database publication system](http://prez.dev) to provide access to.

The Prez Manifest specification is online at:

* <https://prez.dev/manifest/>

This repository contains the `prez-manifest` Python package that provides a series of functions to work with Prez Manifests. The functions provided are:

* `create_table`: creates an ASCIIDOC or Markdown table of Manifest content from a Manifest file
* `validate`: validates that a Manifest file conforms to the specification and that all linked-to assets are available
* `load`: loads a Manifest file, and all the content it specifies, into either an n-quads file or a Fuseki database
