            text : "Let us start learning about linear equations in two variables. Imagine you have two friends, let's call them x and y. A linear equation is like a rule for these friends. For example, 2x + 3y = 10. This rule says that if x has 2 things and y has 3 things, their total should be 10 things. In a linear equation with two variables, you deal with two unknowns, usually represented as x and y. The general form of a linear equation in two variables is ax+by=c, where a, b, and c are constants."
