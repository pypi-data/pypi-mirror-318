Utils are part of the framework and used across tools and utilities, but they are usually not extended by contributors.

Utils could be:

- Used to manage the configuration
- Used to manage the Typer context, where objects are staged across commands
- Used to manipulate particular arguments in Typer commands
- Etc.
