## Installation

You can install **Music Downloader** via `pip`. Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.

```bash
pip install qa-download
```

## Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Dependencies**: The required Python packages are automatically installed with the `qa-download` package.

## Usage

Once installed, you can use `music-downloader` directly from the command line. Below are detailed instructions and examples to help you get started.

> **Recommended**: Using the song name (instead of a YouTube URL) yields more accurate metadata from Genius.

### Basic Command Structure

```bash
music-downloader "input" [--output_dir "/path/to/save"] [--lyr "lyrics_url_or_search_term"] [--video]
```

### Downloading by Song Name

Using a song title allows **Music Downloader** to fetch accurate metadata, album artwork, and lyrics from Genius.

```bash
music-downloader "Let Me Down Slowly Alec Benjamin"
```

**Example with Custom Output Directory:**

```bash
music-downloader "Let Me Down Slowly Alec Benjamin" --output_dir "/path/to/save/music"
```

### Downloading by YouTube URL

If you have a specific YouTube URL, you can use it directly. However, using the song title is recommended for richer metadata.

```bash
music-downloader "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3OyeBuD1h0"
```

**Example with Custom Output Directory:**

```bash
music-downloader "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3OyeBuD1h0" --output_dir "/path/to/save/music"
```

### Downloading by YouTube Playlist

To download an entire YouTube playlist, simply provide the playlist URL. **Music Downloader** will download each video in the playlist and attempt to match metadata from Genius for each song.

```bash
music-downloader "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3oW2tjiIxvQjL36vHTlFlX-1KeaJKTzC"
```

### Using the `--lyr` Option

The `--lyr` option allows you to specify either a URL to scrape lyrics from or a direct search term for Genius metadata.

#### 1. Providing a Lyrics URL

When you provide a URL (e.g., a Genius lyrics page), **Music Downloader** will scrape the lyrics from that page and embed them into the MP3 file. It will still fetch other metadata like title, artist, and artwork from Genius based on the YouTube video's title.

```bash
music-downloader "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3OyeBuD1h0" --lyr "https://genius.com/Alec-benjamin-let-me-down-slowly-lyrics"
```

#### 2. Providing a Genius Search Term

If `--lyr` is not a URL, **Music Downloader** treats it as a search term to fetch metadata from Genius. This allows you to specify an exact search string for better metadata matching.

```bash
music-downloader "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3OyeBuD1h0" --lyr "Alec Benjamin Let Me Down Slowly"
```

### Downloading as Video (MP4)

By default, **Music Downloader** downloads audio as MP3 files. To download the full video in MP4 format, use the `--video` flag.

```bash
music-downloader "Let Me Down Slowly Alec Benjamin" --video
```

**Example with Custom Output Directory:**

```bash
music-downloader "Let Me Down Slowly Alec Benjamin" --output_dir "/path/to/save/videos" --video
```

### Complete Example Commands

```bash
# Recommended method for best metadata
music-downloader "Let Me Down Slowly Alec Benjamin"

# Using a single YouTube video URL
music-downloader "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3OyeBuD1h0"

# Using a YouTube playlist URL
music-downloader "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3oW2tjiIxvQjL36vHTlFlX-1KeaJKTzC"

# Downloading with a custom lyrics URL

# Downloading as MP4 with custom output directory
music-downloader "Let Me Down Slowly Alec Benjamin" --output_dir "/path/to/save/videos" --video
```

## Command-Line Options

- **`input`**: The YouTube URL, playlist URL, or song title you want to download.
- **`--output_dir`**: Specifies a custom directory to save the downloaded file. Defaults to your system's Music directory.
