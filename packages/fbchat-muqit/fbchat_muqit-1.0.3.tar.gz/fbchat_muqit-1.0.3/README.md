## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

You can install fbchat-muqit using pip:

```bash
pip install fbchat-muqit
```

## Documentation

The API is not Documented yet. However, It's design is similar to fbchat v1.9.7
So you can look at [fbchat documentation](https://fbchat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) until we release our Documentation for fbchat-muqit. While following fbchatv1.9.7 remember that fbchat-muqit is an asynchronous library while fbchat is synchronous.


## üìñ Usage Example

Some basic examples

```python

from fbchat_muqit import Client, Message, ThreadType
import asyncio

# Create a class use Client as base Class
class Test(Client):
    async def onListening(self): #type: ignore
        print("I'm Listening")

    async def onMessage(self, mid, author_id: str, message: str, message_object: Message, thread_id, thread_type=ThreadType.USER, **kwargs):
        """you will rec"""

        # author_id is message sender ID
        if author_id != self.uid:
            await message_object.reply("Hello! This is a reply")
            await message_object.react("‚ù§Ô∏è")
            # mid is message ID
            await self.sendMessage("Hello", thread_id, thread_type, reply_to_id=mid)

    async def onPeopleAdded(self, added_ids, author_id, thread_id, **kwargs):
        # `added_ids` is a list of uid of the added people
        thread_type = ThreadType.GROUP
        mention = added_ids
        if self.uid not in added_ids:
            await self.sendMessage("Welcome to the Group!", thread_id, thread_type, mentions=mention)

    # There a lot of methods available

async def main():
    cookies_path = "./c.json"
    bot = await Test.startSession(cookies_path)
    if await bot.isLoggedIn():
        # fetch bot account
        fetch_bot = await bot.fetchUserInfo(bot.uid) # retuens dict {id: User}

        bot_info = fetch_bot[bot.uid] # access `User` object

        print("Logged in as", bot_info.name)

    try:
        await bot.listen()
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)


asyncio.run(main())


```
