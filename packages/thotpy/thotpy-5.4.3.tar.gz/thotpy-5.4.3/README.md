# ThotPy v5.4.2

Welcome to the **T**ext en**H**ancement & **O**ptimization for scien**T**ific research with **Py**thon; or just **ThotPy**, as the modern incarnation of the ancient Egyptian god of writing, wisdom and magic, [Thot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoth).  

This Python3 package allows you to create, edit and analyze all kinds of text files, with a special focus on ab-initio calculations. In particular, it contains interfaces for [Quantum ESPRESSO](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/) and [Phonopy](https://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/).

> **Also check...**  
> Just as the ancient Egyptian god, ThotPy is *married* with [MaatPy](https://github.com/pablogila/MaatPy), another useful python package to analyze spectral data from your experiments. Check it out!  
> Note that ThotPy was formally known as InputMaker.  


# Installation

As always, it is recommended to install your packages in a virtual environment:  
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## With pip

To install ThotPy with pip, run:  
```bash
pip install thotpy
```

## From source

Optionally, you can install ThotPy from the last GitHub release. First install the dependencies:  
```bash
pip install pandas
```

Then clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/pablogila/ThotPy/) or download the [latest stable release](https://github.com/pablogila/ThotPy/tags) as a ZIP, and run inside the `/ThotPy/` directory:  
```bash
pip install .
```

- [call](https://pablogila.github.io/ThotPy/thotpy/call.html). Run bash scripts and related.

Along with the [core](https://pablogila.github.io/ThotPy/thotpy/core.html) submodule with common utilities.

## Interfaces for ab-initio codes

The following interfaces for ab-initio codes are included:
- [qe](https://pablogila.github.io/ThotPy/thotpy/qe.html). Interface for [Quantum ESPRESSO](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/) calculations.
- [phonopy](https://pablogila.github.io/ThotPy/thotpy/phonopy.html). Interface for [Phonopy](https://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/) calculations.

## Compiling the documentation
